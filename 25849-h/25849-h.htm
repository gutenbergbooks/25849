<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Proposal and an Acceptance</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Alvin Landon and Chester
Haynes were having a merry time
in the home of Mike Murphy, when
a servant knocked and made known that
a caller was awaiting Alvin in the handsome
bungalow belonging to his father.
I have told you how the boys hurried
thither, wondering who he could be, and
how they were astonished to find him the
&#8220;man in gray,&#8221; who had become strangely
mixed up in their affairs during the preceding
few days.
</p>
<p>But Alvin was a young gentleman, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
asked the stranger to resume his seat, as
he and Chester set the example. They
noticed that the visitor was without the
handbag which had hitherto seemed a part
of his personality. Self-possessed and
vaguely smiling, he spoke in an easy,
pleasant voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are surprised to receive
a call from me.&#8221; He addressed Alvin, who
replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deny it. Heretofore you have
seemed more anxious to keep out of our
way than to meet us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I admit that it did have that look, but
the cause exists no longer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This remark did not enlighten the youths.
Chester for a time took no part in the conversation.
He listened and studied the
man while awaiting an explanation of what
certainly had the appearance of a curious
proceeding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what could have
been the cause in the first place,&#8221; said
Alvin, &#8220;nor why my friend and myself
should have been of any interest at all to
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>The other laughed lightly, as if the curt
remark pleased him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no wish to play the mysterious;
my name is Stockham Calvert.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Alvin&#8217;s turn to smile, while Chester
said meaningly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That tells us mighty little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am one of Pinkerton&#8217;s detectives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The listeners started. They had never
dreamed of anything of this nature, and
remained silent until he should say more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are aware,&#8221; continued the mild
spoken caller, &#8220;that there have been a
number of post office robberies in the southern
part of Maine during the last six
months and even longer ago than that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A professional detective doesn&#8217;t know
his business when he proclaims his purpose
to the world. He does so in the story
books, but would be a fool to be so imprudent
in actual life. Consequently you will
think it strange for me to take you into
my confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt you have an explanation
to give,&#8221; suggested Alvin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have and it is this. Without any
purpose or thought on your part you have
become mixed up in the business. The
other night you gave me great help, though
the fact never entered your minds at the
time. You located their boat in a small
inlet at the southern extremity of Barter
Island.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this point Chester Haynes asked his
first question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know we did?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Stockham Calvert indulged in a low
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely I did not follow you thither
without learning all you did. Your conversation
on the steamer gave me the information
I wished. I did not expect you
to succeed as well as you did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you avoid us? Why didn&#8217;t
you take us into your confidence from the
first?&#8221; asked Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had several reasons, but I see now it
would have been as well had I done so.
However, let that go. My errand here
to-night is to ask you whether you will not
assist me in running down these criminals.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>The abrupt proposition caused a start on
the part of the youths, who looked wonderingly
into each other&#8217;s face. It was Alvin
who replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Assist you! What help can <i>we</i> give?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the fleetest motor boat on
the Maine coast. It must be capable of
twenty miles an hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is guaranteed to make twenty-four.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better yet. These men have a boat
which closely resembles yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And its name is the <i>Water Witch</i>,&#8221;
said Chester. &#8220;I wish Captain Landon
could run a race with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can have the chance if he will agree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fail to see how. Those men after
committing their crimes are not going to
spend their time in running up and down
the Sheepscot or Kennebec.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not wholly, but I don&#8217;t see any particular
risk they incur in doing so. If
they are pressed hard they can put into
some bay or branch or inlet and take to
the woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still I do not understand how we can
help you, Mr. Calvert,&#8221; said Alvin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible you cannot, but more
probably you can. While cruising in these
waters, we may catch sight of their boat,
and you can see the advantage of being
able to outspeed it. But do not think I
am looking for a battle between you and
me on the one hand, and the criminals on
the other. I wish to employ the <i>Deerfoot</i>
as a scout. I can&#8217;t express myself better
than by that word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whatever the right name of the caller
might be, he was a good judge of human
nature. He saw the sparkle in the eyes
before him. While the lads would not
have been averse to a scrimmage, neither
dared incur such risk without the consent
of his father, and you do not need to be
told that such consent was out of the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I understand it, then, our boat
promises to be useful to you solely on account
of its speed?&#8221; said Alvin inquiringly
asked the detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely. What is your answer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young Captain looked at his second
mate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How does it strike you, Chester?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you if you wish to make the
experiment. If things don&#8217;t turn out as
we wish we can withdraw at any time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shall expect to pay you for
your services&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will be disappointed,&#8221; interrupted
Alvin crisply. &#8220;The <i>Deerfoot</i> isn&#8217;t
for hire, and if we go into this it will be
for the fun we hope to get out of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can guarantee you some entertainment.
I presume you two will be
the only ones on the boat beside myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t overlook my first mate,
Mike Murphy. It would break his heart
if we should go on a cruise and leave him
behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid he is too impetuous and
too fond of a fight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have a weakness in those directions,
but his good nature, pluck and devotion
to my friend and me more than
make up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help how it strikes you,&#8221; broke
in Alvin, who did not intend to accept any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
commands at this stage of the game.
&#8220;Mike goes with us wherever we go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel the same way,&#8221; added Chester.
&#8220;The <i>Deerfoot</i> can never brave the perils
of the deep short-handed. The first mate
is indispensable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you please then. When will you be
ready to start?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you wish us to start?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say to-morrow morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is so sudden,&#8221; said Alvin, whose
spirits rose at the prospect of the lively
times ahead. &#8220;We ought to have a little
while to think it over. However, if my
second mate, who generally has views of
his own, will agree, we&#8217;ll get under way
to-morrow after breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wid ye, as Mike would say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose, Mr. Calvert, we leave it this
way: if we decide to go into this business,
we&#8217;ll make the venture to-morrow morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay at the Squirrel Inn to-night
and be on the wharf a little before nine,
on the lookout for you. If you do not
show up then or soon after I shall not
expect you. Your boat will be in plain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
view all the time, so I shall see you when
you start.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not stay with us over night? We
shall be glad to have you do so,&#8221; was the
hospitable invitation of Alvin Landon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; replied Stockham
Calvert, rising to his feet; &#8220;but I came
over in a rowboat which is waiting to take
me back. I engaged my room at the inn
this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He bade them good night and walked
briskly down the slope. The boys stood
in front of the bungalow until they heard
the sound of the oars and saw the dim outlines
of the boat and its occupants heading
eastward toward the twinkling lights from
the inn and cottages on Squirrel Island.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it all?&#8221; asked
Alvin of his chum, when after some
minutes they returned to the big sitting
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to answer you,&#8221;
replied Chester. &#8220;It looks to me as if we
are bound to have lively times before we
get through with the business. But, Alvin,
all the time that man was talking I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
felt a curious distrust of him. He said he
is a detective, but I&#8217;m not sure of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose he belongs to the gang that is
playing the mischief with Uncle Sam&#8217;s post
offices in this part of the Union?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that were so, what in the world can
he want of you and your boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of its fleetness it may serve
him when he needs it. However, I don&#8217;t
see that any harm can come to it or to us.
He can&#8217;t pick up the launch and run away
with it and he would find it hard to do so
with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not forgetting Mike Murphy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you accept his proposal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I, but we together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; it&#8217;s a go.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Scout of the Kennebec</span></h3>
</div>

<p>AT nine o&#8217;clock on a bright sunshiny
morning in August the usual
group were gathered on the dock
at Squirrel Island. Some were watching
the arrival and departure of the different
steamers, not forgetting the little <i>Nellie G.</i>,
plying between that summer resort and
Boothbay Harbor, some three miles distant,
with calls at other islands as the
passengers wished. Sailboats were getting
ready to take parties out, some to fish,
while others sought only the pleasure of
the cruise itself. Small launches came up
to the low-lying float for men and women
to get on board, while others were rowed
out in small boats to the anchored craft.
</p>
<p>By and by the attention of most of the
spectators was fixed upon the beautiful
<i>Deerfoot</i>, which, putting out from the lower
end of Southport Island opposite, was heading
toward Squirrel. The picture had become
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
familiar to all and they admired the
grace and symmetry of the launch which
had won the reputation of being the swiftest
of its kind in those waters. It was known
that she was owned by Alvin Landon, the
son of a millionaire who had built a handsome
bungalow on Southport, where he was
expected to spend his vacation days, though,
as we know, he passed precious few of
them there. Alvin was holding the wheel
of his boat, while directly behind him sat
his chum, Chester Haynes, calmly watching
their approach to the floating dock.
</p>
<p>The third member of the crew was our
old friend Mike Murphy, whose official
rank was first mate. Instead of sitting
among his companions, the Irish lad had
gone to the stern, where he sat with his
legs curled up under him tailor fashion.
He could not get much farther in that
direction without slipping overboard. The
figure of Mike was so striking that he drew
more attention than did his comrades or
the boat itself. His yachting cap was
cocked at a saucy angle, revealing his fiery
red hair, while underneath it was his broad,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
crimson face, sprinkled with freckles, and
his vast grin revealed his big white teeth.
It will be remembered that the remainder
of his costume was his ordinary civilian
attire, though Captain Alvin Landon had
promised him a fine suit for the following
season. The time was too short to secure
one for the present occasion.
</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s good-natured grin awoke more
than one responsive smile among the crowd
on the dock. The universal opinion was
that the youth from the Emerald Isle was
so homely of countenance that he couldn&#8217;t
be any homelier, but at the same time none
could be more popular. He knew that the
eyes of nearly every one were fixed upon
him and he in turn scanned the different
faces, all of which were strange to him.
</p>
<p>Alvin Landon slowed down as he approached
and guided his boat among the
others with the skill of a professional chauffeur
weaving in and out of a procession of
carriages. He gave his whole attention to
this task, Chester watching the performance
with the admiration he had felt many
times before. But it was the people who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
interested Mike. Before the boat rounded
to, Stockham Calvert, the detective, accompanied
by Lawyer Westerfield, of New
York, walked down the inclined steps to
the float. Westerfield was a gentleman of
culture, an authority on many questions
and one of the greatest baseball fans in
the country. Having secured a liberal
money contribution from Calvert the night
before at the Inn, he invited him to stay
and witness the great struggle between the
Boothbay nine and the Squirrel Islanders.
Westerfield was to act as umpire, his impartiality
and quickness of perception
having won the confidence of all parties;
but of course Calvert had to decline under
the pressure of a previous engagement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It does a fellow good to look at that
broth of a boy squatting on the stern,&#8221;
remarked Westerfield, while the <i>Deerfoot</i>
was still a short distance away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Mike and he is a great
favorite with every one. As yet I have
not met him, but he has all the wit and
humor of his people. Suppose you test
him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>Nothing loath, Westerfield, who was a
bit of a wag himself, called so that all
heard him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to show a red signal
light, my friend; you ought to wait until
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cocking his head a little more to one
side, and with a slight extent of increase
in the width of his grin&mdash;admitting that
to be possible&mdash;Mike called back:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thin why have ye the <i>graan</i> light
standing there on the wharf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Westerfield joined in the general laugh,
but came back:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That face of yours will keep off all
danger by daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s yer own phiz that will sarve
the same purpose at night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The laughter was louder than ever, and
the pleased Calvert said to the lawyer:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better let him alone; he will down you
every time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Westerfield could not refuse to make
another venture. Stepping back as if in
alarm from the launch, which was now
within arm&#8217;s reach, he feigned to be scared.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t bite me with those dreadful
teeth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike, who was now close to the wharf,
leaped lightly upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have no fear; the sight of yersilf has
made a Joo of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then as if afraid that the listeners would
not catch the force of his words, he added:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Joo, as ye may know, doesn&#8217;t ate
pork.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Detective Calvert slapped the lawyer on
the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I have had enough.&#8221; Then raising
his hat and bowing in salutation, Westerfield
offered his hand to the lad, who shook
it warmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too much for me, Mike. I&#8217;m
proud to take off my hat to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s me dooty to be equally respictful,
as me dad said whin the bull pitched
him over the fence and stood scraping one
hoof and bowing from t&#8217;other side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While still in the boat, Alvin and Chester
had returned the salutation of Calvert.
The Captain remained seated at the wheel,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
but the second mate stepped out on the
float and a general introduction followed.
The detective and he went aboard and sat
down on one of the seats. Mike kept
them company, and throwing in the clutch,
Alvin guided the launch into the spacious
waters outside, all three waving a salute
to Westerfield, who stood on the float and
watched them for some minutes.
</p>
<p>Detective Calvert had the good sense
fully to admit Mike Murphy to his confidence,
though he had hoped at first he
would not be a member of the party. Alvin
Landon gave the man to understand that
he was not hiring out his boat, but was
conferring a favor upon the officer, who
had the choice of rejecting or accepting it
on the terms offered. While Calvert could
not doubt the loyalty of the young Hibernian,
he distrusted his impulsiveness. But
as I have said, having decided upon his
line of conduct, he did not allow himself
to show the slightest degree of distrust.
</p>
<p>Mike on his part was tactful enough to
act as listener while the man made clear
his plans. He did not ask a question or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
speak until addressed. The launch moved
so quietly that Alvin, with his hands upon
the wheel and scanning the water in front,
heard all that was said by the others, and
when he thought it fitting took part in the
conversation.
</p>
<p>Instead of returning to Southport, the
Deerfoot circled Cape Newagen, which you
know is the southern extremity of that
island, and entering the broad bay, headed
up the Sheepscot River, over the same
course it had followed before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike was not with you,&#8221; said Detective
Calvert, &#8220;when you traced the other
launch into that little inlet at the lower
end of Barter Island. That boat stayed
there overnight and may still be there,
but probably is not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose it isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; said Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must find out where she is. That
is the chief reason for my presuming upon
the kindness of the Captain to lend me the
help of his launch. In other words, it is
my wish that the <i>Deerfoot</i> shall serve as
the Scout of the Kennebec.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A romantic title,&#8221; remarked Alvin, over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his shoulder, &#8220;though we are not cruising
on the Kennebec, but up the Sheepscot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt we shall have to visit the
larger river. And then, you know,&#8221; added
Calvert, with a smile, &#8220;the name I suggest
sounds better than the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The launch required no special attention
just then, and, with one hand on the steering
wheel, Captain Alvin looked around:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike, what do you think of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, what&#8217;s the difference what
ye call the boat? At home, I was sometimes
referred to as the Queen of the May,
and again as the big toad that St. Patrick
forgot to drive out of Ireland, but all agraad
that I was as swate under one title as the
ither.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose the <i>Water Witch</i> happens to
be where Chester and I saw her at night?&#8221;
asked Alvin of their director.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to decide our course of
action by what develops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Neither of the youths was fully satisfied
with this reply. They could not believe
that a professional detective would come
this far upon so peculiar an enterprise
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
without having a pretty clear line laid out
to follow. It may have been as he said,
however, and he was not questioned further.
</p>
<p>The day could not have been finer. The
threatening skies of a short time before had
cleared and the sun was not obscured by a
single cloud. Though warm, the motion
of the launch made the situation of all
pleasant. Since there was no call for haste,
Calvert suggested to the Captain that he
should not strain the engine, and Alvin
was quite willing to spare it. The time
might soon come when it would be necessary
to call upon the boat to do her best,
and he meant she should be ready to
respond.
</p>
<p>Past the Cat Ledges, Jo and Cedarbrush
Islands moved the <i>Deerfoot</i> like a swan
skimming over the placid waters. Then
came Hendrick Light, Dog Fish Head,
Green Islands and Boston Island. Powderhorn
was passed, and then they glided by
Isle of Springs, which brought them in
sight of Sawyer. A little beyond was the
inlet where they had seen the <i>Water Witch</i>
reposing in the darkness of night.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>At the Inlet</span></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;SLOW down,&#8221; said Detective Calvert
as the launch drew near the
southern end of Barter Island.
Captain Alvin did as requested and all
eyes were fixed upon the inlet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If that boat should happen to come
out while we are in sight,&#8221; added Calvert,
&#8220;pass up the river, as if you had no interest
in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if it should happen to be there?&#8221;
said Alvin, repeating the question he had
asked before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t know until we have turned
in, and then it would not do to withdraw,
for that would be the most suspicious
course of all. You have as much right to
go thither as anyone. Act as if you were
merely looking in out of curiosity; make a
circuit of the islet and then come back
and go on up the Sheepscot toward Wiscasset.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>It was at this moment that Mike Murphy
asked a question whose point the others
were quick to perceive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the spalpeens are there, will ye let
&#8217;em have a sight of yersilf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I shall drop down and hide, for
if they noted that you had me for a passenger
they might smell a rat, but would
think nothing of seeing you three, for they
know you travel together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the launch drew near the opening,
Alvin slackened her speed still more until
she was not going faster than five or six
miles an hour. There was an abundance
of sea room and he curved into the passage
with his usual skill. The four peered intently
forward and had to wait only a
minute or two when the boat had progressed
far enough to give them a full
view of the crescent-like cove, which extended
backward for several hundred yards
and had an expansion of perhaps four hundred
feet. In the very middle was the islet,
in the form of an irregular oval, containing
altogether barely an acre. As has
been said, it was made up of clay and sand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
with not a tree or shrub growing, and only
a few scattered leaves of grass, but there
was no sign of life on or about it.
</p>
<p>Alvin sheered the boat close to the shore,
and continued slowly moving. A glance
downward into the crystal current showed
that the depth was fully twenty feet, so
that it was safe for the largest craft to
moor against the bank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where the <i>Water Witch</i> lay,&#8221;
said Alvin. &#8220;Do you wish to land, Mr.
Calvert?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was standing up and scrutinizing the
little plot as they glided along the shore,
but discovered nothing of interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there&#8217;s no call to stop; we may as
well go back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do ye obsarve that six-masted schooner
wid its nose poked under the bushes in the
hope of escaping notice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Mike Murphy asked the question he
pointed to the southern shore of the inlet,
where all saw the little rowboat in
which Detective Calvert had visited the
spot and which had been used later for a
similar purpose by Alvin and Chester. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
was drawn up so far under the overhanging
limbs that only the stern was in sight.
It seemed to be exactly where it had been
placed by the boys after they were through
with it.
</p>
<p>It was on the tip of Alvin&#8217;s tongue to
refer to the incident and to ask something
in the way of explanation from their companion.
Instead of doing so, the latter
surprised both by saying:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That must belong to somebody who
lives in the neighborhood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The remark sounded strange to our young
friends and both remained silent waiting
for him to say more, but he did not. He
sat down again, facing the Sheepscot, and
lighted one of his big black cigars. He
crossed his legs like a man of leisure who
was not concerned by what had occurred or
was likely to occur.
</p>
<p>The incident impressed Alvin and Chester
unfavorably. Mike, not having been with
them at the time, knew nothing of it. To
each of the former youths came the disquieting
questions:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he believe we did not know him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
that night? Does he think neither of us
suspected what he did? <i>Is he what he
pretends to be?</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>These queries opened a field of speculation
that was endless, and the farther
they plunged into it the more mystified
they became. Alvin would never stoop to
ask favors of this man. He was trying to
aid him in carrying out a good purpose,
and he must &#8220;be on the level,&#8221; or the Captain
would have nothing to do with him or
his plans.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first proof I get that he is playing
double,&#8221; muttered Alvin, &#8220;I&#8217;ll order him
off the boat and never let him set foot on
it again, and, if he belongs to that gang of
post office robbers, I&#8217;ll do everything I can
to have him punished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the most discomforting frames of
mind into which any person can fall is to
see things which make him distrust the
loyalty of one upon whom he has depended.
It might be Alvin Landon was
mistaken and Stockham Calvert was in
reality a Pinkerton detective whose sole
aim was to bring these criminals to justice;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
but, as I have shown, the full truth was
still to be learned.
</p>
<p>And Chester Haynes&#8217; feelings were the
same as those of his chum. He glanced
at the man who was puffing his perfecto,
and wondered who he really was and what
was to be the end of this curious adventure
upon which he and Alvin had entered.
</p>
<p>It was a brief run out to the Sheepscot,
and the <i>Deerfoot</i> headed up the river again
toward Wiscasset. A steam launch was
seen off to the left and a catboat skimmed
in the same direction with our friends.
Both were well over toward Westport, the
left-hand bank, and slight attention was
given them.
</p>
<p>The <i>Deerfoot</i> had not reached the upper
end of Barter Island when Alvin from his
place as steerer called out:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks like the boat we are hunting
for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Running closer in to the right shore
than the <i>Deerfoot</i>, a second boat was visible
whose similarity of appearance caused astonishment.
The bows of the two being
pointed toward each other, the view was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
incomplete at first, but since the speed of
each was all of ten miles an hour, they
rapidly came opposite. Alvin sheered to
the left, so as to make an interval of a
hundred yards between them. Chester had
caught up the binoculars and kept watch
upon the launch, his companions doing
what they could without the aid of any
instrument.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the <i>Water Witch</i>!&#8221; said Chester
excitedly.
</p>
<p>A minute before he did so, Detective
Calvert quietly slipped from his seat to
the floor, removed his hat and cautiously
peered over the taffrail. But he did not
cease smoking his huge cigar, and it struck
Alvin when he looked around that his
head was high enough to be in plain sight
of anyone watching from the other craft.
</p>
<p>Mike Murphy caught the stir of the
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How many passengers do ye obsarve
on the same frigate? It seems to me there
be only two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all that are visible,&#8221; replied
Chester, holding the glass still leveled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thin they must be them two that we
had the shindy wid the ither night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly; in fact I recognize the
one you pointed out at Boothbay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the ither must be the ither one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is every reason to believe so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thin&mdash;&mdash;I say, Captain,&#8221; said the agitated
Mike, turning to Alvin, &#8220;would ye
be kind enough to run up alongside that
ship?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you wish me to do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish&mdash;that is&mdash;I wud like to shake
hands wid that gintleman and ask him
how his folks was whin he last heerd from
them. Just a wee bit of friendly converse
betwaan two gintlemen&mdash;that&#8217;s all. Come
now, Cap, be obliging,&#8221; continued Mike, in
a wheedling tone which did not deceive his
superior officer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I faal a sort of liking for the young
gintleman and should be much pleased if
ye would give me a chance to have a few
frindly words wid him&mdash;I say, Cap, ye&#8217;re
losing vallyble time, fur we&#8217;re passing each
ither fast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mike&mdash;not to-day; I have no objection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
to your having a little &#8216;conversation&#8217;
with Mr. Noxon or his companion, but this
isn&#8217;t the right way to go about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope ye didn&#8217;t suspict that I had any
intintion of saying harsh wurruds to them,
Cap!&#8221; protested the Irish youth, in grieved
tones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not words particularly, but there would
be enough rough acts to make things lively.
Chester, let me have the glasses, while you
take the wheel for a few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They hastily exchanged places, and
steadying his position, Alvin pointed the
instrument at the receding launch. Detective
Calvert still knelt on the floor and
peeped over the side of the boat. He did
not ask for the binoculars nor did the owner
offer them to him.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Alvin slipped down beside his
friend in front and passed him the instrument,
as he resumed the wheel. While
doing so, he whispered in a voice so low
that no one else could hear what he
said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look just behind the fellow who is
steering. He&#8217;s Noxon, I&#8217;m sure! Study
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
closely and let me know whether you see
anything suspicious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wondering to what he referred, Chester
complied. While doing his best to learn
what his friend meant the latter whispered
again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see anything, be careful to let
no one besides me know what it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester nodded, with the glasses to his
eyes. The opportunity for scrutiny was
rapidly diminishing. Chester held the
binoculars level but a minute when he
lowered them again. The commonest courtesy
compelled him to offer them to the
detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you can discover something,&#8221;
remarked the youth as he passed them
over. The posture of the man gave him
the best chance he could ask, and he carefully
studied the receding boat until it was
so far off that it was useless to continue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice anything special?&#8221; asked
Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw nothing but those two young
men, with whom as I learn from the Captain
he had an affray some nights ago.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Chester leaned over and whispered to
Alvin:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it plainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man crouching down among the
seats as Calvert did and peering over like
him.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A STRANGE RACE</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the <i>Water Witch&#8217;s</i> whistle
sent out a series of piping toots.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of that?&#8221;
asked Chester of Detective Calvert, who
had quietly resumed his seat in one of the
wicker chairs in front of the youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a challenge to a race.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I accept it,&#8221; said Alvin, with a flash
of his eyes. At the same moment he
swung the wheel over and began circling
out to the left, so as to turn in the shortest
possible space. &#8220;If that boat can outrun
me I want to know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be keerful ye don&#8217;t run over him,&#8221;
cautioned Mike, catching the excitement,
&#8220;as Tam McMurray said whin he started
to overtake a locomotive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin quickly hit up the pace of the
launch, which sped down the Sheepscot
with so sudden a burst of speed that all
felt the impulse. The sharp bow cut the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
current like a knife, the water curving over
in a beautiful arch on each side and foaming
away from the churning screw. Even
with the wind-shield they caught the impact
of the breeze, caused by their swiftness,
and each was thrilled by the battle
for mastery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you doing your best?&#8221; asked Calvert,
watching the actions of the youthful
Captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I am making about two-thirds of
the other&#8217;s speed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t do any better, is my advice,&#8221;
said the detective.
</p>
<p>Alvin glanced over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be wise at this stage of the
game not to let them know that you can
surpass them. Wait till the necessity
arises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Mr. Calvert,&#8221; added
Chester, and the Captain was impressed
by the logic of the counsel. He was on
the point of increasing the pace, but refrained.
In truth he was already wondering
what they would do if they overtook
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the other and what could be gained by
passing the boat.
</p>
<p>Again the whistle piped several times and
it was evident that the fugitive, as it may
be called, had &#8220;put on more steam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to let her get away
from us?&#8221; asked Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for the present, but that may be
the best course. Hold your own for awhile
and then gradually fall back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the race opened, less than an
eighth of a mile separated the contestants.
The abrupt burst lessened this slightly and
then it appeared to be stationary as the
two glided down the river.
</p>
<p>Such were the relative positions when
the <i>Water Witch</i> shot past Ram Island,
holding the middle of the stream, and a
few minutes later came abreast of Isle of
Springs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two young fellows have a man
with them,&#8221; remarked Calvert. &#8220;He tried
to keep out of sight when we first met,
but now he doesn&#8217;t seem to care. You
can see him plainly without the help of
the glasses.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>Such was the fact, and Chester said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;They must know that we also have a
friend with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it matters either way.
I think you are gaining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But not half fast enough,&#8221; added Mike,
who was standing and impatient to beat
their opponent. &#8220;We must come up wid
the spalpeens before they git to Boothbay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not heading for Boothbay,&#8221;
observed Calvert, whose keen eyes had
detected the change in the line of flight.
His companions saw he was right. The
front boat had made so abrupt a change
of course that it was almost at right angles
to that of the pursuer. The side of the
launch was exposed, showing the two
youths, one of whom held the wheel, while
the man with a mustache sat directly
beside the other. It might be said of the
two craft and their crews that they were
twins, so marked was their resemblance.
</p>
<p>Naturally Alvin shifted his line of pursuit.
You may recall that, opposite the
Isle of Springs, Goose Rock Passage connects
Sheepscot River with Knubble Bay,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
which leads into Montsweag Bay, reaching
northward on the western side of the long
island of Westport. In their first trip
northward our young friends had gone to
the eastward of Westport, as they had
been doing during this race. Montsweag
Bay takes the name of Back River at the
northern end of the island and that and
the Sheepscot unite above before reaching
Wiscasset.
</p>
<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> dived into Goose Neck
Passage past Newdick Point, where it
turned northward into Knubble Bay. This
is the path taken by the steamers from
Bath and other places on the Kennebec
when going to Boothbay Harbor, Squirrel
Island and other points. To the westward
of these bodies of water sweeps the noble
Kennebec to the sea.
</p>
<p>Just ahead was discerned a swiftly approaching
mass of tumbling water, above
which the deck, pilot house and puffing
smokestack of a little steamer showed.
This was the &#8220;pony of the Kennebec&#8221;&mdash;the
<i>Gardiner</i>, plowing ahead in such desperate
haste that one might well believe the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
fate of a score of persons depended upon
its not losing a half minute. Alvin took
good care to give her plenty of room and
saluted with several whistle toots. There
was no reply. The captain merely glanced
at the two craft and sped onward like an
arrow from the bow of the hunter.
</p>
<p>The <i>Deerfoot</i> rocked and plunged in the
swell made by the steamer, which, spreading
out like a fan from its bow, ran tumbling
and foaming along the rocky shores,
keeping pace with the headlong charge of
the boat, and trying to engulf everything
in its path. One small catboat that was
tied to a rickety, home-made landing, after
a couple of dives capsized, as if it were a
giant flapjack under which a housewife had
slid her turning iron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gaining!&#8221; exclaimed Chester,
who was closely watching the progress of
the racers. &#8220;Do you mean to let them get
away, Alvin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Calvert will answer that question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do so by advising that you neither
gain nor lose for the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Captain gave the launch a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
more power, and it became clear to all
that the pursuer was picking up the ground,
or rather water, that she had lost. Then
for several minutes no difference in speed
was perceptible. A space of a furlong
separated the two when they shot past
the point of land bearing the odd name of
Thomas Great Toe, which is on the western
side of the lower part of Westport, some
two miles above Goose Neck Passage.
Here the water is a mile in width, and is
filled with islands of varying sizes, until
the large bay to the northward is reached.
</p>
<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> persisted in hugging the
eastern shore, while her pursuer kept well
out, as if to make sure of having plenty
of room in which to pass her, when the
chance came. But all the same the chance
did not come. It was soon seen that the
fugitive was drawing away from her pursuer.
Mike Murphy fumed, but held his
peace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mesilf that hasn&#8217;t any inflooence
here,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;as I obsarved to mysilf
whin dad and mither agreed that a
thundering big licking was due me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can you overhaul her?&#8221; asked Detective
Calvert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Easiest thing in the world; I can shoot
past her as if she were lying still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike could remain silent no longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a dooce of a way to run a race!
Whin ye find ye can bate the ither out of
sight ye fall back and let her doot. That&#8217;s
the style I used to run races wid the ither
boys at school, but the raison was I couldn&#8217;t
help it. If ye&#8217;ll allow me to utter a few
words of wisdom I&#8217;ll do the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin nodded his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is that ye signal to that pirut ahead
to wait and give us a tow, being that&#8217;s the
only way we can howld our own wid &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now while it was trying to Alvin and
Chester to engage in a race of the nature
described and voluntarily allow the contestant
to beat them, when they knew they
had the power of winning, yet they believed
it was the true policy, since Detective
Calvert had said so. They understood
the disgust of Mike and could not
forbear having a little fun at his expense.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Chester gravely, &#8220;those
two young men who gave you and Alvin
such a warm time the other night are on
the other boat, and if we should come to
close quarters with them they would be
pretty sure to even up matters with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike glared at the speaker, as if doubting
the evidence of his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phwat is that ye&#8217;re saying?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that the dearest object of
yer heart? I shall niver die contint till I
squar&#8217; matters wid &#8217;em, and ye knows the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; added Calvert, with the
same seriousness, &#8220;that they have a full-grown
man to help them out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And haven&#8217;t we a full-grown man wid
us, as me dad said whin he inthrodooced
me to his friends at Donnybrook, I being
&#8217;liven years old? Begorra, I&#8217;m thinking we
haven&#8217;t any such person on boord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a pretty sharp retort, but the
officer could not repress his amusement at
the angry words. Alvin looked over his
shoulder and winked at Calvert and Chester,
making sure that Mike did not observe the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
signal. In his impatience, he had turned his
back upon them and was looking gloomily
over the stern at the foaming wake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if there isn&#8217;t some tub along
the shore that&#8217;ll put out and run us down.
I hope, Captain, that whin we git back
home ye&#8217;ll kaap this a secret from dad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll sure give me the greatest walloping
of me life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For what reason?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For consoorting wid a party that run
away from the finest chance in the wurrld
for a shindy. It&#8217;s a sin that can be wiped
out in no ither way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain to him,&#8221; said Calvert,
&#8220;that you couldn&#8217;t help yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s mighty little difference that
will make, as Terry McCarthy said when
he had the ch&#8217;ice of foighting two Tipperary
byes or three Corkonians.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t your father prefer to have us
bring you home safe and unhurt rather
than to have your beauty battered out of
you?&#8221; inquired the detective, with a solemn
visage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>Mike, who had risen to his feet and was
still staring over the stern, slowly turned
and faced the questioner. Then, with an
expression of contempt, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye haven&#8217;t the honor of an acquaintance
wid me dad.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Loser of the Race</span></h3>
</div>

<p>A long, low bridge connects the
western projection of Westport with
Woolwich on the opposite bank,
beyond which spreads Montsweag Bay,
narrowing to Back River, which, as has
been explained, joins the Sheepscot.
</p>
<p>The draw had just been swung open
when our friends came in sight of the
bridge, and saw the <i>Water Witch</i> passing
through. The bridge tender immediately
began turning his lever with which he closed
the draw. Alvin whistled to signify that
he wished to follow the other, but seemingly
the man did not hear him. His
back steadily rose and fell, as he worked
the handle of his contrivance, and the
movable section of the structure slowly
swung back in response.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that lucky now!&#8221; was the sarcastic
exclamation of Mike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Chester.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to hilp ye fall back further
behind the ither boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be something in that,&#8221; the
Captain replied.
</p>
<p>None the less, Alvin continued his tooting,
without abating his speed. The tender,
however, did not mean to tantalize them,
and all quickly saw the cause of his action.
A heavily loaded wagon had come upon
the bridge from the Woolwich side, and
waited while the draw was held open.
The driver must have had a &#8220;pull&#8221; with
the attendant, who immediately closed the
draw so he could cross before the second
boat passed through.
</p>
<p>At this juncture fate showed how perverse
she can be when in the mood. Directly
over the draw, something connected
with the wagon or the harness of the team
got askew and the driver paused to set
it right. Possibly it was pretence on his
part, for many men will do such things,
but, all the same, he took ten minutes
before he climbed back on his seat and
started his horses forward again. Alvin
reversed the screw, so that the launch
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
became motionless when a few yards from
the bridge.
</p>
<p>I am afraid the driver purposely delayed
the <i>Deerfoot</i>, for when Mike shouted an
angry reproach, he looked around, put his
thumb to his nose, twiddled his fingers,
and then moved slowly over the rattling
planks toward Westport.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suggist that ye turn about, Captain,
and scoot for home,&#8221; was the ironical advice
of the Irish youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For what reason?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afeard that man is real mad and
he might take it into his head to git down
off his wagon and saize aich of us by the
nape of the neck as the boat goes through,
and slam us down so hard he&#8217;d jar us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait, Captain, till he&#8217;s a little
farther off,&#8221; advised Calvert; &#8220;there may
be something in what Michael says.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As for Mike, feeling he could not do
justice to the subject, he held his peace
for the moment.
</p>
<p>Gliding through the draw and entering
Montsweag Bay, the occupants of the
<i>Deerfoot</i> were surprised to see nothing of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the other launch. She was as invisible
as if she had been scuttled and sunk in
fifty feet of water.
</p>
<p>The right shore above the structure,
belonging to Westport, slopes to the right,
and something like a half mile above, this
course is at right angles to the stream. It
is really a peninsula, there being an inlet
more than a mile long which divides it
from the rest of Westport. This little
bay is spanned by a bridge which forms a
part of the highway that passes over the
longer structure already referred to.
</p>
<p>When Mike found the <i>Water Witch</i> had
vanished, he pretended to be vastly relieved.
He had dropped into his chair and
now straightened up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But ain&#8217;t we lucky?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; asked Calvert.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t been stopped at the
bridge the ither boat might have broke
down and we&#8217;d come up wid the same, and
those chaps would have give us all a good
spanking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you are becoming so prudent,&#8221;
said Calvert, with an approving nod.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
&#8220;We must take Michael with us whenever
we are likely to run into danger. Captain,
if you don&#8217;t mind, you might tune up your
boat a bit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait,&#8221; suggested Mike, &#8220;fur ye
might gain on t&#8217;other one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin now put on the highest speed of
which the <i>Deerfoot</i> was capable. The bow
rose, the stern settled down in the water,
and the spray was flung high and splashed
against the wind-shield. The exhaust deepened
to a steady roar, and the broadening
wake was churned into a mass of tumbling
soapy foam. The whole boat shivered
with the vibration of the powerful engine.
She was going more than twenty miles an
hour&mdash;in fact, must have approached her
limit, which was four miles faster. Alvin
had attained such a tremendous pace only
a few times in his practice and did not like
it. Though his instructor had assured him
that the launch was capable of holding it
indefinitely without injury, he feared a
breakdown or the unnecessary wear upon
many parts of the engine.
</p>
<p>He kept up the furious speed until they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
curved around the upper part of the peninsula
and saw the expansion above, all the
way to Long Ledge, where Back River
begins. He had been confident of catching
sight of the <i>Water Witch</i>, but she was nowhere
in sight.
</p>
<p>The natural conclusion was that the
launch had taken on a higher burst of
speed&mdash;probably the limit&mdash;and gone so
far that by still keeping near the shore
she had placed several miles behind her&mdash;enough
to carry her out of the field of
vision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it up till we catch sight of her
again,&#8221; suggested Calvert. &#8220;I believe there
are no more bridges between us and Wiscasset.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Some three or four miles were passed
at high speed, when they reached a portion
of the river which opened a view of still
greater extent. They saw two small sailboats
at a distance, and a little steamer
puffing northward, but nothing of the
<i>Water Witch</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may as well slow down,&#8221; remarked
the detective, who, guarding a match with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
his hands behind the wind-shield, proceeded
to light another cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; asked Alvin,
turning his head, as the pace became
slower than before.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have passed the other boat; she
is behind us instead of in front.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For hiven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t go back,&#8221; protested
Mike. &#8220;Ye might find her&mdash;and
then what would become of ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective now gave his view of the
situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we should turn round and find that
boat, those on board would know we were
looking for them. We don&#8217;t wish to give
that impression, at least for some time to
come. While we were going in one direction
and they in another, they challenged
us to a race. Any two boats might have
done the same in the circumstances. We
have to accept defeat and that&#8217;s all there
is to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Calvert looked at his watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is near noon; if you all feel as I do
you would welcome a good dinner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the most sensible sense that I&#8217;ve
heerd since we started,&#8221; remarked Mike,
who was as hungry as his companions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a long run to Wiscasset,&#8221;
said Alvin; &#8220;and there&#8217;s more than one
good hotel there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking that at the speed ye&#8217;re
going, we&#8217;ll hardly arrive in time for supper.
There must be some place betwixt
here and the town where we can git enough
to stay the pangs of starvation till we
raich Wiscasset.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall pass several landings, and
there are farmhouses along shore where
I&#8217;m sure the folks will be glad to accommodate
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others were not much impressed
with Mike&#8217;s plan, but since there was
plenty of time at their command, they fell
in with it. Alvin suggested that all should
keep a lookout for an inviting dwelling,
when, if a good landing could be made,
they would stop and investigate.
</p>
<p>Chester offered to relieve his chum at
the wheel, and Alvin was quite willing to
exchange places with him. The occurrences
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
of the last hour or more, together
with what was said by Detective Calvert,
had increased the confidence of the youths
in him. True, they could not understand
the full object of this cruise up the river,
after gaining sight of the launch and the
occupants for whom he had been searching.
They were content to await explanation
on that point, but Alvin determined that
one or two things which puzzled him and
Chester should be cleared up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Accepting what you said last night at
my home, Mr. Calvert, I must say for myself
and friend that we do not understand
some of your actions. Perhaps you won&#8217;t
mind explaining them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to do so, if it is prudent
at this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will pardon me for saying that in
our opinion you acted foolishly when you
followed us off the steamer the other day
at Sawyer Island, pretended you had made
a mistake in landing there, and then dogged
us to that little inlet. We saw you several
times, but you either wished or pretended
you wished to keep out of our sight, as, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
instance, after crossing that long bridge from
Hodgdon to Barter Island. You followed
us, but when we stopped at the side of the
road to wait for you, you slipped among
the trees and made a circuit round the spot.
Why did you do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective smiled, and smoked a
minute or two before replying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was undignified, though a
man in my profession has to do a good
many things in which he casts dignity to
the winds. The truth is, I formed the intention
of getting off at Sawyer as soon as I
heard your friend Mr. Richards say he
thought he had caught sight of your launch
in that cove. I was trying to get track
of the same parties, but prudence whispered
to me that the time had not yet come in
which you and I should hitch up together.
I suspected it might soon be advisable,
but not just then. My pretence of having
left at the wrong landing was a piece of
foolishness meant only to afford you and the
agent a little amusement, but I feared you
would run into trouble with those criminals
and I decided to keep you under my eye.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Until I concluded to trust you, it was just
as well that you should distrust me. For
several reasons, which I won&#8217;t explain at
this point, I came to the belief last night
that it was time we made common cause.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Warm Reception</span></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I have me eye on the right place,
as Father Mickle said whin he wint
into the saloon to pull out Jim
Gerrigan by the nape of his neck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike Murphy pointed to a small, faded
yellow house which stood at the top of a
gentle slope on their right. It was a hundred
yards from the river and a faintly
marked, winding path led from it down to
the bank. The surrounding land showed
meagre cultivation, and the looks were anything
but inviting.
</p>
<p>On the little porch sat a big man with
grizzled whiskers, smoking a brier-wood
pipe, his beamlike legs crossed and his arms
folded as he moodily watched the launch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me as a poor promise,&#8221; remarked
Alvin, who, nevertheless, asked
Chester to steer to the shore to see whether
a landing could be readily made. The
prospect was good, as a shaky framework
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
had evidently been placed there for use,
though no small boat was near.
</p>
<p>Chester brought the <i>Deerfoot</i> alongside
with the skill that the owner of the launch
would have shown. Alvin sprang lightly
upon the structure, which sagged under his
weight, caught the rope tossed to him by
Chester, and fastened it around one of the
rickety supports. The boat was made fast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk up to the house and have a
talk with the gintleman,&#8221; said Mike, stepping
carefully out upon the boards. &#8220;Do
I look hungry?&#8221; he asked of Alvin, who
replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You always have that expression.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it, fur I wish to impriss
the gintleman that that&#8217;s my condition.
I&#8217;ll assoom a weak, hisitating walk.
Do ye abide here aginst me return and
repoort.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Detective Calvert retained his seat and
lighted another cigar. Chester sat with
his hand idly resting on the wheel. Alvin
kept his place on the tiny dock, and all
three watched Mike Murphy. They smiled,
for the stooping shoulders of the Irish youth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
and his feeble gait were those of a man of
four-score. The huge stranger sat like a
statue, slowly puffing his pipe, his glowering
eyes fixed on the approaching lad.
</p>
<p>With each advancing step, Mike&#8217;s doubts
increased. The nearer he came to the
stranger, the more forbidding he appeared.
Had the lad followed his inclination he
would have turned back, but he knew his
friends were watching him. Besides which,
he was really hungry.
</p>
<p>He had passed half the distance between
the boat and the house, scrutinizing the
scowling fellow all the time, when the latter
made his first movement. He uncrossed
his huge legs, took the pipe from between
his lips and emitted a low whistle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be so cheered at sight of me
that he is obleeged to give exprission to
his feelings&mdash;Begorra!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Around the end of the house dashed a
mongrel dog, and halting abruptly with
pricked ears, glanced at his master to hear
his command. The canine was of moderate
size, black and white in color, one eye
wrapped about by an inky splash of hair
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
that made him look as if the organ was in
mourning.
</p>
<p>Holding the pipe away from his lips,
the man pointed the stem toward Mike,
who had paused, and said to his dog:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick him, Nick! Sick him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the dog proceeded to &#8220;go for&#8221; the
caller. Had the latter run away, the brute
would have been at his heels, nipping and
biting at each step. But Mike had no
thought of retreating. He was filled with
anger at his inhospitable reception and gave
his whole attention to the animal, which
with a muttered growl charged full speed
at him.
</p>
<p>Mike noticed that a collar with projecting
spikes encircled the stumpy neck, and
never was one of his breed more eager to
bury his teeth in a victim&#8217;s anatomy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to be a shindy sure, as
Micky Rooney said when he tackled five
p&#8217;licemen&mdash;and I haven&#8217;t even a shillaleh
in hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike coolly braced himself for the shock,
not yielding an inch nor turning his gaze
from his foe. It was no longer a doddering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
old man who faced the stranger, but a
sturdy youth, muscular, brave and always
eager for the fray.
</p>
<p>Nothing could surpass the skill with
which the first assault was repelled. At
the exact moment Mike launched his shoe,
the toe of which caught Nick under the
jaw and caused him to turn a backward
somersault. He uttered several yelps, but
the blow added if possible to his rage.
</p>
<p>The dog was so bewildered for the moment
that he lost his sense of direction,
and made a dash toward the porch where
his master was watching proceedings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick him, Nick! Sick him!&#8221; he called,
pointing his finger at the lad.
</p>
<p>Nick impetuously obeyed orders, and at
the critical moment Mike launched a second
kick, which, however, was not delivered
with the mathematical exactness of the
first. It landed in the canine&#8217;s neck and
drove him back several paces, but he kept
his balance, and came on again with the
same headlong fierceness as before.
</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Stockham
Calvert flung away his cigar, sprang from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
his chair and with one bound landed beside
Alvin Landon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend that Mike shall get into
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he laid his hand on his
hip pocket where reposed his revolver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if it&#8217;s the dog that is in
trouble,&#8221; replied Alvin, his cheek tingling
with pride at sight of the bravery of his
comrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he had to fight only one brute I
shouldn&#8217;t fear, but there are two against
him. When Mike is through with the dog
he will have to face his master. I shall be
ready to give him help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to shoot the fellow?&#8221;
said the alarmed Captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be necessary,&#8221; was the quiet
response.
</p>
<p>The next exploit of Mike was brilliant.
He did not kick at the dog, for that only
deferred the decisive assault, but as the
mongrel rose in air, he side-stepped with
admirable quickness, gripped him by the
baggy skin at the back of his neck, and,
slipping his hand under the spiky collar,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
held him fast. The brute snarled, writhed,
snapped his jaws and strove desperately
to insert his teeth into some part of his
captor, who held him off so firmly that he
could do no harm.
</p>
<p>Mike now turned and began walking
hurriedly toward the launch, with the
squirming captive still in his iron grip.
</p>
<p>The infuriated owner sprang from his
seat and leaped down the steps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop that dog!&#8221; he shouted, striding
after Mike, who called back:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop him as soon as I raich the
river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Afraid of being checked, the youth broke
into a trot, and an instant later was at
the landing, the yelping mongrel still firmly
gripped. Back and forth Mike swung him
as if he were the huge bob of a pendulum,
and then let go. He curved over the launch,
like an elongated doughnut, and dropped
into the current with a splash. But all
quadrupeds swim the first time they enter
the water. In an instant, the brute came
to the surface, and working all his legs
vigorously, came smoothly around the stern
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
of the launch, and headed for Mike with
the purpose of renewing the attack.
</p>
<p>The man, who had dropped his pipe and
strode down the walk, was over six feet in
height, of large frame, and manifestly the
possessor of great muscular strength. Although
he knew his dog had suffered no
harm and was safe, he was enraged over
his maltreatment and resolute to wreak
vengeance upon the author of the insult.
</p>
<p>Mike read his purpose, poised himself
and put up his fists.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the next dog and it&#8217;s mesilf
that is ready fur him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It would give me pleasure to tell how
Mike Murphy vanquished the giant who
attacked him, but such a statement would
be as untrue as absurd. You have read of
the dude who daintily slipped off his kid
gloves, adjusted his eyeglasses, and proceeded
to chastise an obstreperous cowboy;
but take it from me that no such thing
ever occurred, except in stories. Nature
governs through rigid laws, and two and
two will always make four. It might have
been creditable to the courage of the Irish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
youth thus to engage in a bout with a man
who would have quickly beaten him to the
earth, but it would have shown very poor
judgment. Had they clashed there could
have been only one end to the encounter.
</p>
<p>But they did not clash. Several paces
separated the two, when Stockham Calvert,
his thin gray coat buttoned around
his trim form, stepped quickly between
them, and, looking sharply into the face of
the savage stranger, said in a voice that
showed not the least agitation:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! he&#8217;s my friend!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He raised one hand, palm outward by
way of emphasis of his warning words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded the other,
stopping short, his eyes flaming above his
shaggy beard and under his straw hat, like
an animal glaring through a thicket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on and you&#8217;ll learn!&#8221; was the
reply in the same even tones, as Calvert
assumed the posture of a trained pugilist.
</p>
<p>Now it is proper to say of this man that
he had been the champion boxer in college,
and in his New York club he was easily
the master of every one with whom he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
donned the gloves. Though of only average
size and stature and inclined to thinness,
his muscles were of steel, he had the
quickness of a cat, and had been told more
than once, that if he would enter the
&#8220;magic circle&#8221; he would hold his own with
the best in the profession. But, like all
gentlemen who are masters of the manly
art, he disliked personal encounters, and
many a time had submitted to insulting
words and even the accusation of timidity,
rather than to call his iron fists and superb
skill into play. You might have been in
his company for months without suspecting
his attainments in that respect. His
business required that he should always
carry a revolver, and when he placed his
hand on his hip at sight of Mike Murphy&#8217;s
personal danger, the action was instinctive,
but he instantly gave up all thought of
using so deadly a weapon. He was certain
there was no necessity for it; he had no more
doubt of his mastery of the bulky brute, who
was equally confident, than he had of his
ability to handle any one of the three lads
who were his companions.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Science versus Strength</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Had the large man undergone the
scientific training of the smaller
one, he might have overcome him,
for, as has been said, he was immensely
powerful and must have been a third
heavier than Stockham Calvert. But he
was out of condition, and, worse than all
for him, had not the slightest knowledge
of the &#8220;manly art.&#8221; When he doubled
his huge hairy fists, he charged upon the
detective like a roaring bull, expecting to
beat down his smaller antagonist as if he
were pulp.
</p>
<p>The pose of the defendant was perfect.
Resting easily on his right foot, the left
advanced and gently touching the ground,
he could leap forward, backward or to one
side with the agility of a panther. The
left fist was held something more than a
foot beyond the chest, the elbow slightly
crooked, while the right forearm crossed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
the breast diagonally at a distance of a
few inches. This is the true position, and
the combatant who knows his business always
looks straight into the eyes of his
opponent. The arms and body are thus
in his field of vision, whereas if he once
glances elsewhere he lays himself open to
a sudden blow.
</p>
<p>With that alertness which becomes second
nature to a pugilist, Calvert saw before the
first demonstration that his foe had no
knowledge whatever of defending himself.
He allowed him to make a single rush, his
big fists and arms sawing space like a windmill.
He struck twice, swishing the air
in front of Calvert&#8217;s face, and gathered
himself to strike again, when&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>Not one of the three spectators could
ever describe how it was done, for the action
was too quick for the eye to follow.
But, all the same, that metal-like left fist
shot forward with the speed of lightning,
and landing on the point of the chin, the
recipient went down like an ox stricken by
the axe of a butcher. Rather curiously, he
did not fall backward, but lurched forward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and lay senseless, knocked out in the first
round.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have killed him!&#8221; whispered the
scared Captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it, but he will be dead to
the world for ten or fifteen minutes. We
may as well let him rest in peace. What&#8217;s
become of that dog?&#8221; asked the officer,
glancing inquiringly around.
</p>
<p>Chester pointed toward the house. The
brute, with his two inches of tail aimed
skyward, was scooting around the corner
of the building as fast as his bowed legs
could carry him. He would not have done
so had he been of true bulldog breed, but
being a mongrel, there was a big streak of
yellow in his make-up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s come to the belief that it&#8217;s a
good time to adjourn, as me cousin said
whin someone blowed up the stump on
which he was risting his weary body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have had enough foraging
along the river,&#8221; remarked Captain Alvin,
who re-entered the boat and resumed his
place at the wheel. &#8220;We dine at Wiscasset.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not partic&#8217;lar as to the place,&#8221; said
Mike, &#8220;if only we dine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester flung the loop of rope off the
support, and he and the others stepped
aboard the launch, which moved up the
river. Standing in front of the detective,
Mike, with his genial grin, offered his hand:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asks the privilege of a shake of yours.
I apologize for thinking ye didn&#8217;t like a
shindy as well as the rest of us. I&#8217;m sorry
for me mistake, as me uncle said, whin he
inthroodoced dad to a party of leddies as
a gintleman. I couldn&#8217;t have done better
mesilf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The smiling officer cordially accepted the
proffer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one can doubt your pluck, Mike,
but, to quote your favorite method of expressing
yourself, you showed mighty poor
judgment, as the owner of the bull said
when the animal tried to butt a locomotive
off the track. That man would have eaten
you up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;P-raps, but he would have found me
hard to digist. Do ye obsarve?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He pointed to the little landing which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
they were leaving behind them. All looked
and saw the burly brute of a man slowly
rise to a sitting posture, with his hat off
and his frowsy hair in his eyes, as he stared
confusedly after the launch speeding up the
river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is recovering quicker than I expected,&#8221;
was the only remark Calvert
made, as he turned his back upon the fellow
and gave his attention to lighting another
cigar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has the look of a fellow mixed and
confused like, similar to Pat McGuigan,
whin he dived off the dock and his head
and shoulders wint through a lobster pot
that he didn&#8217;t obsarve in time to avoid
the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming round all right,&#8221; said Calvert,
referring to the man they had left
behind, though he did not glance at him.
&#8220;He may not be very pretty, but he knows
more than he did a little while ago. Which
reminds me to say something that ought
to have been said at our first interview.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three listened to the words of Calvert,
who clearly was in earnest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Each of you knows that I am a professional
detective who has been sent into
Maine to do all I can to capture the gang
that is robbing the post offices in this section.
I told you that much, but I wish to
ask you to be very, very careful not to
say this to any person whom you may meet,
until you have my permission to do so.
Some would insist that it was unprofessional
on my part to say what I did, but
I had good reason for it, as will appear
before I am through with the business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not necessary to tell Chester
and me that, but I suppose you wish to
run no risk that can be avoided.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it; I did not doubt your loyalty,
but you know we can&#8217;t be too careful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike was leaning back in his chair deeply
thinking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one waak p&#8217;int in the plan
suggisted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as no one had submitted a
plan the three wondered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me friend doesn&#8217;t wish us to tell anyone
that he&#8217;s the best detictive and scrapper
outside of our family in Ireland, but when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
folks priss their questions, some answer
must be given or &#8217;spicions will be stirred.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is well taken. I don&#8217;t wish
you to tell an untruth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the task is not difficult fur the
Captain and second mate,&#8221; interrupted
Mike, &#8220;though it&#8217;s beyond me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can evade a direct reply.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I vinture upon another suggistion?&#8221;
asked Mike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall all be glad to hear it, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Without waiting for questions to be
asked, I&#8217;ll step up to ivery one that I
obsarve casting an inquiring eye over ye
and say ye&#8217;re my older brither, that took
a hand in the Phoenix Park murders, but
broke out of Dublin jail and thus escaped
hanging, and yer kaaping dark in Ameriky
till the little matter blows over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A brilliant idea!&#8221; laughed the officer.
&#8220;All I ask is that you give no truthful
information about me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye doesn&#8217;t objict to my telling folks
how ye laid out that Goliah a bit ago?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer you should not mention it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>Mike sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, have ye no pride of family, as Tam
O&#8217;Toole used to say whin mintioning the
fact that all his five brithers were in jail,
where Tarn himsilf ought to have been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may add,&#8221; continued the man, &#8220;that
it is quite likely we shall soon part company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike affected to be surprised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the Captain pay ye &#8217;nough
wages?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no fault to find on that score.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to larn that. If he requires ye
to do too much dooty, I&#8217;ll hilp ye out, the
bist I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise to call upon you if necessary,
Mike, but I hope I shall not be obliged to
do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been wondering since we started,&#8221;
said Alvin over his shoulder, &#8220;whether
by any possibility the <i>Water Witch</i> kept on
up the river ahead of us instead of running
into some bay or inlet to the south.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible, but not probable. You
know we had an extended view of this
stream, or rather of Montsweag Bay, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
she could not have gone far enough in the
short time to pass out of sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye forgits how anxious the Captain was
not to overtake her,&#8221; reminded Mike.
&#8220;I once read of a farmer who chased a big
black bear that had been staaling his sheep
fur two days and nights and then quit.
Can ye guess why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say that after so long a chase
he would have given up disgusted,&#8221; replied
the detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not that; it was &#8217;cause he found
the tracks were becooming too fresh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think, Mike, that you are in
danger of being accused of that,&#8221; ventured
Chester, &#8220;because you are always fresh&mdash;you
are never <i>becoming</i> so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the same is becooming to me, as
Jim Flannery said whin he walked into
church wid two black eyes and his head
bent out of shape from the shindy he had
with his twin brither over the quistion of
aiting maat on Friday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem quite sure that these three
whom we saw in the launch are mixed up
in these post office robberies?&#8221; asked Alvin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It has that look. No matter how
certain I may feel, nothing can be accomplished
until legal proof is obtained. You
know the rule that every man must be
presumed to be innocent until proved
guilty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It shtrikes me that the most important
quistion of all has been sittled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;These two young gintlemen are the
spalpeens that tried to hold ye up, Captain,
the ither night on yer way home. That
fur outweighs the taking of a few postage
stamps from some country offices.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The puzzling feature of that business,&#8221;
said Alvin, &#8220;is that when you meet those
two fellows again, you will not have Mr.
Calvert along to protect you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike stared as if he failed to catch the
meaning of this astounding remark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plaise say that agin, Captain, and say
it slow like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin&#8217;s face being turned away, he was
not forced to maintain his gravity while he
repeated in his most serious tones the
remark quoted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All I have to say to that is not to say
anything, as Teddy Geoghan observed whin
they found a stolen pig in the bag he was
carrying over his shoulder which the same
he insisted was filled with clothes for
Widow Mulligan.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Lone Guest</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The <i>Deerfoot</i> glided through the
smooth waters, and while the afternoon
was still young rounded to at
the wharf, below the long wooden bridge
which spans the stream at Wiscasset, and
made fast where a score of other boats of
all sizes and models were moored. Several
large vessels were anchored farther out
and Captain Alvin Landon had to slow
down to thread his way among them.
There was plenty of room, and the launch
was tied up opposite a small excursion
steamer which was to start southward an
hour later. A tip to the old man who was
looking after a number of yachts assured
the safety of the last arrival from molestation.
</p>
<p>The possibility that the <i>Water Witch</i>
had preceded them to Wiscasset caused a
scrutiny of the various craft in sight by
the Captain and his crew, including Detective
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Calvert, but nothing was seen of the
boat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is miles off down stream,&#8221; was the
remark of the officer, &#8220;and for the present
is out of the running.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The four walked up the easy slope to the
main street, along which they passed to
the leading hotel for dinner. They were a
little late and when they went into the
spacious dining room found a table by
themselves. The only other occupant was
a tall, angular man of about the same age
as Calvert, similarly attired and apparently
giving his sole attention to the meal before
him. He nodded to the group in a neighborly
way, but did not speak.
</p>
<p>When the four took their places at the
small table, Calvert faced this person a
short distance away; Chester Haynes sat
with his back to him, thus confronting the
detective, while Mike and Alvin occupied
the respective ends of the board. These
details sound trifling, but they had a meaning.
Calvert thus distributed his companions
apparently off-hand, but the seating
of himself as mentioned was done with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
purpose. Chester then, from the position
he occupied, was the only one of the other
three who observed anything significant in
that action and in what followed.
</p>
<p>In the first place, the officer raised his
glass of water, and while slowly drinking
looked over the top at the lone guest.
Chester noticed that he sipped the fluid
longer than common, gazed at the stranger
and deliberately winked one eye. What
response the other made of course could not
be seen by Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The two are acquaintances,&#8221; was the
conclusion of the lad, &#8220;and they don&#8217;t
wish anyone else to know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was curious to know whether Alvin
and Mike had noticed anything of the
by-play. The Irish lad for the time devoted
himself to satisfying his vigorous hunger
and cared for naught else. The same was
to be said of the Captain. Chester remained
on the alert.
</p>
<p>Several trifling incidents that occurred
during the meal, which was enlivened by
the wit of the Irish lad, confirmed Chester
in his first suspicion. Calvert tried to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
divert possible suspicion by cheery remarks
and pleasant conversation as the meal
proceeded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure, Mike, you never had any
such feasts in the old country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Having said this, the detective coughed
several times and held his napkin to his
mouth, but Chester knew the outburst was
forced, and was meant to carry to the
other man, who rather curiously coughed
the same number of times immediately
afterward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A message and its reply,&#8221; was the
thought of Chester, &#8220;but I have no idea of
what they mean. Mr. Calvert doesn&#8217;t
wish me to see anything and I won&#8217;t let
him know I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mike made his response to
the inquiring remark of Calvert:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re right, me frind, as Hank
McCarthy said whin dining on one pratie
and a bit of black bread, calling to mind
his former feasting in his own home. Which
reminds me, Mr. Calvert, to ask, did ye
iver see the heart of an Irishman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure I grasp your meaning,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Mike,&#8221; was the reply, while Alvin and
Chester looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can bist explain by a dimonstration,
as the tacher said whin I asked him what
was meant by the chastisement of a school
lad. Now, give heed, all of ye, and I&#8217;ll
show ye what I meant by the sinsible
inquiry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Among the different articles of food
on the table was a dish of &#8220;murphy&#8221;
potatoes with their &#8220;jackets&#8221; on. That is,
they had not been mashed or peeled, though
a strip was shaved off of each end. They
were mealy and white, and Mike had
already placed several where they were
sure to do the most good. The tubers in
boiling had swollen so much that most of
the skins had popped open in spots from
the richness within.
</p>
<p>Mike reached over and carefully selected
a big murphy, which he held with the
thumb of his left hand and fingers circling
about it. The upper end projected slightly
above the thumb and forefinger, as if peeping
out to watch proceedings. The three
stopped eating for the moment and watched
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
the youth. While doing this, Chester
glanced for an instant at the face of the
officer, and saw him look quickly across
the room and telegraph another wink.
</p>
<p>Like a professional magician, Mike was
very deliberate in order to be more impressive.
The true artist does not overlook
the minutest point, and he daintily adjusted
the potato, shifting it about until it was
poised exactly right. Then he slowly
raised his open right hand, with the palm
downward, until it was above his head.
Like a flash he brought it down upon the
upper end of the tuber, which shot through
the loose encircling grasp as if fired from an
air gun. The skin remained, but the potato
itself whisked down upon the table with
such force that it popped open, and lo!
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the heart of an Irishman&mdash;Begoora!
but I&#8217;m mistook!&#8221; exclaimed
Mike in dismay, for when the tuber burst
open the interior was black with decay!
</p>
<p>Calvert threw back his head and roared,
and Alvin and Chester came near falling
from their chairs. Even the man at the
other table joined in the boisterous merriment,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
which was increased by the comical
expression of Mike. With open mouth and
staring eyes he sat dumfounded. For once
in his life he was caught so fairly that he
was speechless.
</p>
<p>The deft little trick he had performed
many times, but never before had he been
victimized by what seemed to be a rich,
mealy potato. He couldn&#8217;t understand it.
</p>
<p>Oddly enough the stranger was the first
to recover his speech. He must have had
little liking for Hibernians, since he called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, young man! You showed
us the heart of a real Irishman!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With lower jaw still drooping, Mike
turned his head and stared at the speaker.
He yearned to crush him with a suitable
reply, but all his wit had been knocked out
of him by the cruel blow of fate. However,
it could not long remain so. He picked up
the fragments of the potato, fumbled them
reprovingly and gravely laid them on the
tablecloth beside his plate. Then the old
grin bisected his homely face, and addressing
the three, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a slight mistake, as Jerry Sullivan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
said whin he stepped out of the third
story windy thinking it was the top of the
stairs. If it&#8217;s all the same to yees, we&#8217;ll
now give our attintion to disposing of the
remaining stuff on the boord.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, the four cut in two each
of the potatoes left in the dish. Every
one was as sound as a dollar, whereat all
laughed again, Mike as heartily as any.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a sorry day whin I can&#8217;t take a
joke, as Jim Doolin said smiling whin his
frinds pushed his cabin over on top of him
as he lay sleeping behind it, but I was
niver sarved such a trick before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester thought the unanimous merriment
caused by Mike&#8217;s mishap would open
an acquaintance between the lone guest
and the others, but nothing more was said
by the respective parties, nor did the watchfulness
of the youth detect any further
signals while at the table. Evidently an
understanding had been brought about,
and nothing else was required.
</p>
<p>The meal finished, the four rose to leave
the dining room. While there may have
been nothing meant by Calvert&#8217;s action in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
dropping to the rear, Chester was alert
and glanced back as they walked into the
hall outside. He was rewarded by seeing
the officer turn his head for an instant and
give a slight nod. No doubt it was meant
for the guest left behind, whose response
was invisible to all except him for whom
it was intended. The individual must
have been blessed with a good appetite, or
he followed the sensible policy of lingering
long over his meals, since he began eating
before the little party and continued after
their departure.
</p>
<p>Reaching the pleasant, shady avenue,
the four strolled through the town and
when tired came back to the hotel and sat
down. Chester was on the lookout for
the stranger, but nothing was seen of him.
What did it all mean and what was the
cause of the secrecy between him and
Stockham Calvert?
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he chooses to explain I must wait
until he is ready,&#8221; was the decision of
Chester.
</p>
<p>The afternoon was well forward, when
they walked down the slope to the wharf,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
where the <i>Deerfoot</i> awaited them. Alvin
made a hasty inspection of it and found
everything seemingly all right. As they
were about to step aboard, the officer said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to bid you good-by for
awhile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is that?&#8221; asked the Captain, in
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember I told you it was likely,
but I hope soon to meet you all again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nothing could be said by way of objection,
and he stood on the wharf as Alvin
seated himself after adjusting the plug
and swinging over the fly-wheel. The boat
circled out into the broad stream, and all
waved their hands to the officer, who
responded similarly. Then he turned about
and went slowly up the slope, probably to
the hotel where they had dined.
</p>
<p>When everything was moving easily,
and the boat was gliding down stream,
Chester sitting directly beside his chum
told him all that he had observed in the
dining room. Mike had gone to the stern
of the launch and sat down in his favorite
position, with his feet curled up under him.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Break Down</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Alvin was keenly interested
in the story of Chester Haynes.
He admitted that he had noticed
nothing peculiar, and it was evident that
Mike had been equally blind to the events
passing under their eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is plain,&#8221; said Alvin, &#8220;that although
Calvert told us a good many things about
himself, there is a good deal more he didn&#8217;t
tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That man who was in the dining room
with us may have been another detective
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or what?&#8221; asked Chester, observing the
hesitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to say what comes into my mind,
but every now and then a queer suspicion
steals over me that Calvert is deceiving us
and is not what he claims to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, he is a member of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
gang whom he pretends to be hunting
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ashamed to confess it, but such
has been my fear at times. And yet,&#8221;
the Captain hastened to add, as if regretting
his unworthy thoughts, &#8220;it seems
impossible, when we call to mind all he
did and how he has acted from the first of
our acquaintance with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester was thoughtful for a moment
or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I made up my mind after that rumpus
down stream when he saved Mike from a
bad beating, that he was just what he said,
though I won&#8217;t deny that more than one
thing he has done&mdash;such as following us
from Sawyer Island to the inlet where the
<i>Water Witch</i> lay, and his behavior on the
road&mdash;had a queer look. But what&#8217;s the use
of speculating about it? Sooner or later
we shall know the truth, and, if we don&#8217;t,
I can&#8217;t say I much care. Which course will
you take in going home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any choice; have you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose then you follow Back River,
and around Cape Newagen home. That&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
a pretty good run, and at the rate we are
going we sha&#8216;n&#8217;t get there before dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any reason for the choice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that we may catch sight of the
<i>Water Witch</i>, from which we parted in
those waters. If we do, we shall have to
hold Mike in leash.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it came about that the <i>Deerfoot</i> turned
into the headwaters of Back River, passing
Cushman Point through the Cowseagan
Narrows, and into the more open waters
below. Three or four miles farther would
take them to Montsweag Bay, of which
mention has been made, that body of water
being twice or thrice as wide as the river.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Chester asked an odd question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the launch was injured
by that spurt this forenoon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought not to have been, for she has
gone through the strain more than once
and for a longer time. Why do you ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow or other, it seems to me she
isn&#8217;t running exactly right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is wrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t put my finger on it; I may say
I <i>feel</i> it&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are right, for I have had the
same misgiving ever since we left Wiscasset.
I have tried to figure it out, but can&#8217;t and
am waiting for it to develop, hoping all
the time it won&#8217;t&mdash;hello! there it comes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the speed of the boat was not
affected, the engine began hissing with
vicious persistency.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the wheel, Chester, while I look
around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He first examined the spark plugs, knowing
that if one was broken the result would
be what had just taken place, but all were
intact. He had turned the switch, stopping
the motor, and next inspected the valve
caps where a fracture or loosening would
have caused the hissing. They were sound
and tight and the gaskets where the exhaust
and intake pipes connected with the
cylinders were tight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found it!&#8221; he called to Chester.
&#8220;It&#8217;s an open compression cup, which is
easily fixed; I am glad it is nothing worse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Remembering the lessons he had been
taught, the young Captain soon corrected
the fault and resumed progress. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
launch, however, was held down to a comparatively
slow pace, for the slight slip
naturally caused misgiving. Several minutes
passed with all going well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me safe to give her more
speed,&#8221; said Chester. &#8220;At this rate we
sha&#8216;n&#8217;t reach home until late at night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; turn on more power&mdash;no,
don&#8217;t! <i>Ouch!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin snapped his fingers, as one does
when they are burned. He had placed
them upon the exhaust pipe, which was
growing red hot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut her off! The mischief is to pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Knowing from the gesture of the Captain
what was the matter, Chester asked,
as he obeyed the request:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What causes that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is either something wrong with
the water pump, the spark is retarded, or
a lack of sufficient lubrication, causing the
motor to heat. It will take some time to
find out and we shall have to drift for
awhile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not run to land and tie up? We
may get in the way of some of the boats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
steaming up or down the river if we stay
out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin scrutinized the eastern bank, which
is the upper portion of Westport, and much
nearer than Wiscasset township opposite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The water is so deep that I suppose
we can touch the bank anywhere without
risk to the hull. All right; feel your way
in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The turning of the boat naturally stirred
Mike&#8217;s curiosity and he came back to
learn the cause, which was soon explained
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye have me consint, since I obsarve
there&#8217;s a bit of a town not far off where
we can git enough food to keep off starvation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fir, spruce and pines line the shore of
this part of Westport, the ground rising
moderately inland. A half mile, more or
less, from the river, runs the public highway
from Clough Point, the northern extremity
of Westport, almost to Brooks
Point at the extreme southern end, the
distance being something like fifteen miles,
the entire length of the island.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>The village to which Mike Murphy
alluded stands alongside this road, a half
mile from the shore of Back River. There
was enough rise to the ground to show the
church steeple and the roofs of the higher
buildings. Perhaps it will be well to give
it the name of Beartown, and to say that
it numbered some five hundred inhabitants.
Although its main interest was with the
highway alluded to, yet it had considerable
trade with the river, up and down which
boats of different tonnage steamed, sailed
or rowed during the day, and occasionally
at night. A well-marked road led from a
wharf to the village. Over this freight
was drawn to and fro in wagons, and some
of the less important steamers halted for
passengers who liked that way of going up
or down stream.
</p>
<p>Alvin and Chester thought it better not
to stop at the public wharf, where they
were likely to be in the way of larger craft
and might draw unpleasant attention to
themselves, while engaged in repairing the
launch. Accordingly, the latter timidly
approached the land, several hundred yards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
below the wharf. The water possessed that
wonderful clearness which is one of its
beautiful peculiarities in Maine. The boat
was far out when the change was made in
her course, but she had not gone far when,
looking over the side, the dark, rocky bottom
was plainly seen fully thirty feet below.
There was slight decrease in this depth
until the boat was within a few yards of
land. Even then, it must have been twenty
feet at least, the bottom sloping as abruptly
from the shore as the roof of a house.
Consequently the approach was safe and
easy.
</p>
<p>In such favorable conditions there was
no difficulty in laying the launch near the
bank, where, as in former instances, she
was made fast by the bow line looped
around a sturdy spruce more than six
inches in diameter, and the anchor out
over the stern. Chester tied the knot
securely, and stepped back to give what
help he could to Alvin, who was busy with
the engine. Mike looked on and remarked
that, although he knew nothing at all about
the various contraptions, he held himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
ready to give valuable advice whenever it
was needed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Being as mesilf ain&#8217;t indispinsable just
now, &#8217;spose I strolls up to the city nixt
door and make a few more new acquaintances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no objection to that,&#8221; replied
the Captain, &#8220;but be sure to come back
before dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike sprang lightly to land and set off
on his journey of discovery. It will be
recalled that our friends were some distance
from the highway connecting the
wharf and town and therefore he had to
thread his way among the trees to reach
the direct route to the village. There
was no trouble in doing this: the trouble
came afterward.
</p>
<p>Alvin and Chester gave the lad no
thought, for he surely was old enough to
take care of himself, and there was nothing
in the situation to cause any misgiving.
Their ambition was to get the engine of
the launch in shape. With painstaking
care and the expenditure of more time than
was expected, Alvin finally discovered that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the heat of the exhaust pipe was due to
the clogging of the pump with weeds, and not
to the lack of lubrication or the retarding
of the spark.
</p>
<p>To the disgust of both, when a test was
made with the launch still held immovable,
and the heating was overcome, explosions
in the muffler developed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we must find whether that is
caused by a cylinder missing fire and
pumping the gas into the muffler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How will that do it?&#8221; asked Chester,
who, while a good motor boat pilot, possessed
less practical knowledge than his
chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The charges which I spoke of are
ignited from the heat of the next exhausted
charge. It may be the exhaust valve is
stuck or does not seat properly, or the gas
mixture is too weak to fire in the cylinder,
or the spark may be insufficient or over-retarded.
It is a job to get that straightened
out, and when that is done, perhaps
something else will turn up, but we may
as well tackle it at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was fully dark before the difficulty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
was remedied by a careful readjustment
of the carburettor. Repeated tests were
made, and everything found to be right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; said Alvin, with a sigh of
relief. &#8220;And now we are ready to go home.
But where is Mike?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>At Beartown</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Alvin Landon had been toiling
so long, often in a stooping posture,
that he was tired. He sat down on
one of the seats and his chum placed himself
opposite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad,&#8221; said the Captain,
&#8220;for a fellow can&#8217;t do much of this in the
dark, and I was bothered a good deal as
it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It strikes me that you will be running
into danger by going down the river to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no moon until late. Suppose
the launch should break down when we
were well out in Sheepscot Bay, wouldn&#8217;t
we be in a fix?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I hope she is through breaking
down for some time to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I, but why take the risk, when
there&#8217;s no necessity for it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t fixed to sleep on board,
though we could do it in a pinch, for the
weather is mild.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up to this village or town near
by. I am sure we shall get accommodations
for the night. Truth to tell, Alvin,
I&#8217;m as hungry as I was at dinner to-day in
Wiscasset.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan is a good one, though I don&#8217;t
like to leave the boat by itself till morning.
You know what happened the other
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t occur again in a thousand
years. Put the flags and other stuff in
the cockpit, lock the engine cover, take the
switch plug with you, and the boat will
be as safe as if she had a regiment of men
on guard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike ought to have been back before
this,&#8221; said the Captain, with a touch of
impatience. &#8220;Unless he has a good excuse
I shall demote him, by making you first
mate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a dazzling promise you hold before
me, but it won&#8217;t be fair to condemn Mike
unheard. Give him a chance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>After some hesitation, Alvin acted upon
the advice of his comrade. The launch
was made as secure as possible, and they
sprang ashore, where the gloom among the
trees reminded them of that other tramp
after taking supper with Uncle Ben Trotwood.
There was no reason for going
astray and they followed a direct course
until they reached the roadway between
the wharf and the village of Beartown,
alongside the main road running the length
of the island of Westport.
</p>
<p>The moon had not yet risen; in fact it
would not be up for several hours, but
the sky was clear and studded with stars
which shone with dazzling brilliancy. They
could plainly see the broad trail into which
they turned and walked toward the village.
</p>
<p>Less than a score of paces were passed
when the two caught sight of a figure approaching
through the obscurity. The
person kept in the middle of the road, and
an instant later both recognized him as
their comrade.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; called the Captain, in his
most startling voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>Mike stopped short, but made no motion
to obey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear me?&#8221; demanded Alvin
fiercely, as he strode forward with the
grinning Chester at his elbow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If ye&#8217;ll be kind enough to spell out the
words I&#8217;ll think &#8217;em over and let ye know
me decision to-morrer,&#8221; replied the Irish
youth, who knew the voice, though the
speaker screened himself as much as he
could in the shadow at the side of the
highway. The parties met and shook
hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What kept you so long?&#8221; asked Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I spint the time in making acquaintances,
and before I knowed it, night had
descinded. I &#8217;spose there&#8217;s about two
thousand folks in Beartown as they call it,
and I know &#8217;em all excipt two or three,
the same being out of town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so late,&#8221; said the Captain, &#8220;that
we have decided to stay here overnight&mdash;that
is, if we can get lodgings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, that&#8217;s a sinsible remark
which I ixpicted ye to make, as Arty
Devitt said whin he admitted he was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
biggest fool in Cork. But there ain&#8217;t a hotel
in Beartown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall have to go back to the
boat and either start down the river or
bunk in as best we can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind; supper is waiting
and ye&#8217;re expicted. The house has only
one bed, which av coorse is fur me, while
ye two will have to make shift in the
adj&#8217;ining woodshed. Come on and I&#8217;ll
show ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sensible for once in your life,&#8221; said
Alvin, &#8220;and explain matters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that what I&#8217;m doing?&#8221; asked Mike,
as he turned about and the three walked
toward the sleepy little town.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made frinds wid the postmaster,
which is a fine old lady with a swaat darter.
She has spread supper for us three, and whin
I told her we&#8217;d honor her by staying overnight,
she was that pleased she danced the
Highland Fling and kicked over a barrel
of apples. And what do ye think, byes,
after we&#8217;d talked awhile, we found we was
relatives. What have ye to say to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible. What&#8217;s her name?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Friestone and her daughter is
Nora. It was that name that set me wits
to work. Ye see the leddy thinks&mdash;that
is, after I suggisted the same&mdash;that one of
her ancistors about the time St. Patrick
was driving the snakes out of Ireland was
living there, and immigrated to this country
and he come over wid the ither sarpints.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;St. Patrick died fifteen hundred years
ago,&#8221; said Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thin I &#8217;spose he must be purty dead
by this time, but that isn&#8217;t aginst the fact
of the father of Mrs. Friestone, two or
three thousand ginerations back, paddling
across the Atlantic and sittling in this part
of Maine. I have raison to belave that
one of me own ancisters was a second
cousin to the owld gintleman and came wid
him on the v&#8217;yage. The owld lady doesn&#8217;t
dispoot me, but is inclined to belave the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where do we come in?&#8221; asked
Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was me chaif trouble in gitting
ye folks straightened out. Av coorse, I
made it clear to them that I owned a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
launch, which the same is called the <i>Deerfut</i>,
and I had took ye out fur a sail&mdash;that
I had left ye to thry to run the boat, in
order to taich ye the same, and ye had
broke down. I said ye were half dacent
chaps, and if she would bear in mind that
ye hadn&#8217;t been under me training long, she
would be able to git along wid ye. Nora
said I must bring ye to the house, and ye
should have slaaping accommodations and
as much as folks of yer kind oughter ate.
I reminded them that I had provided ye
with plinty of pocket money and insthructed
ye niver to accept favors widout paying for
&#8217;em. Thus the way has been opened for
ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it would seem, if a tenth part of
what you say is true,&#8221; was the comment
of Alvin.
</p>
<p>The village, which I have thought best
to call Beartown, straggles along both sides
of the highway which runs the length of
Westport island. It has a neat wooden
church, a faded school house, which had
been closed several weeks, it being vacation
time, two stores, a blacksmith and a carpenter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
shop, but lacks a hotel, no one being
enterprising enough to build such a structure
with the meagre prospects he would
have to face. If now and then some
visitor wished to stay overnight in the
place it depended upon his success in
finding lodgings with one of the citizens.
This could not always be done, but it is
safe to say that Mike Murphy won the
favor of so many with whom he came in
contact that a half dozen homes would
have been glad to take him in indefinitely.
Strolling along the highway, his attention
was caught by sight of a modest frame
building, standing near the middle of the
village with the sign in small letters &#8220;Post
Office&#8221; over the front porch, which was
crowded with samples of what were for
sale at the store.
</p>
<p>Entering the open door, he asked in his
most suave manner if there was a letter
for &#8220;Michael Murphy, lately from Tipperary.&#8221;
The thin old lady in spectacles
behind the counter, at the front, pulled
the half dozen missives from the pigeon
hole over which the letter &#8220;M&#8221; showed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
and slowly inspected each. She gently
shook her head:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to have arrived; probably
it will come in the next mail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s genial face became the picture of
disappointment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty qu&#8217;ar. The Duke promised
he would write me two waaks ago
from his castle and return the five pounds
I loaned him. Ye can&#8217;t thrust the nobility.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said the sympathetic postmistress,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how I can help
you. Have patience and all will come
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s yersilf I&#8217;m blaming,
though onraisoning folks are inclined that
way. The matter of a little money doesn&#8217;t
consarn me, but it&#8217;s the aboose of me
confidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then a man came in to inquire for
a letter, and the sweet looking old lady
was obliged to withdraw her attention from
the freckled face before her.
</p>
<p>During this brief interview a girl not
yet out of short dresses stood behind the
counter, measuring out some calico for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
woman in a scoop shovel-bonnet. The
girl&#8217;s face was as mirthful as Mike&#8217;s, and
her black eyes twinkled with mischief.
She heard all that was said, and read the
youth like a book. He looked more at her
than at her mother, and could not help
being pleased with the lively young lady.
Never at loss for an excuse in such circumstances,
he waited at the front of the
store, sighing as if greatly depressed, until
the woman customer paid her bill, accepted
the roll and walked out. Then Mike,
blushing so far as it was possible to do so,
moved respectfully toward the smiling attraction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost me wheelbarrer in coming up
from me launch; have ye anything of the
kind ye would be willing to sell to a poor
orphan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will one be all you want?&#8221; asked the
miss. &#8220;We can furnish you with a dozen
as well as a single barrow. How much
would you like to pay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike was caught. He had taken a
comprehensive survey of the display outside
the store before entering, and was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
sure that only the simplest agricultural
implements were on sale. Furthermore,
he had less than a silver dollar in his
pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to wait to consoolt me partners,&#8221;
he replied, while nature did her best
to deepen the blush on his broad countenance.
&#8220;Ye see it&#8217;s them that has to
do the work fur me, and it&#8217;s only fair on
me side to let them have something to say
about the ch&#8217;ice of tools. What do ye
think yersilf?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you haven&#8217;t any wish to buy
a wheelbarrow, that you haven&#8217;t the money
to pay for it, and I know we haven&#8217;t one
in the store&mdash;so I think further that there
won&#8217;t be any sale so far as wheelbarrows are
concerned.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>At the Post Office in Beartown</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Although Mike Murphy rarely got
the worst of it in a bout at repartee,
he had the true sporting instinct
and liked the winner because of his victory.
It took a bright person to beat
him, but it did happen now and then,
and he enjoyed a clash of wits with one
who proved his master, though in the long
run the youth generally came out ahead.
</p>
<p>When, therefore, the girl in the post
office at Beartown snapped out the remark
just printed, he was roused to admiration.
He threw back his head and the store rang
with his infectious laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra! ye were too much for me that
time. If ye&#8217;ll not think me impudent, I
beg the privilege of shaking hands wid ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The merry sprite, laughing almost as
heartily as he, though with less noise,
reached a dainty hand across the counter
and he grasped it. From behind the rack
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
at the front of the store, the gentle mother
beamed with a smile. She had heard and
understood it all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Nora, you were rude to
the gentleman,&#8221; she said in her silvery
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221; was the hearty response
of Mike. &#8220;I got it that time where the
chicken got the axe&mdash;which the same is
in the neck. It was a fair hit and I desarved
more, though no one could give it
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It may be said that this little incident
fixed Mike in the favor of mother and
daughter. It was hard to resist the rollicking
good nature of the Irish youth,
who was equally impressed by the gentle
goodness of the mother and the sprightly
wit of the daughter. He now called a halt
with his nonsense and gave a true account
of the situation. His two companions were
the sons of wealthy parents and one of
them owned a beautiful motor launch
which broke down while descending the
river from Wiscasset. He had left the two
trying to tinker it in shape, but had doubts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
of their success. In case they failed, it
would be very pleasing to them if they
could get supper and lodging in Beartown.
Would the good woman advise them where
to apply?
</p>
<p>She replied that she would be glad to
meet their wants, though they would be
disappointed with the poor meals and lodging,
for she knew they must be accustomed
to much better. This was the invitation
for which Mike was angling and he promptly
accepted, assuring the woman that it was
a fine piece of good fortune which more
than repaid them for the disabling of their
engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They may repair it and go home,&#8221;
suggested Nora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will make no difference, for I
sha&#8216;n&#8217;t return to them till night comes and
then they&#8217;ll have no ch&#8217;ice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They may not wait for you,&#8221; said
Nora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Little fear of their laving widout me,
so nothing will be done till I arrive, as
Brian O&#8217;Lynn said when he was walking forth
to be hanged.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>With no other purpose in mind than to
force his friends to stay over night in the
village, Mike Murphy loitered. When the
mother and daughter were not engaged
with customers he entertained them by
his quaint remarks, which kept the smile
on their faces. He had seated himself, on
the invitation of Nora, in a chair at the
rear of the store, where he was in no one&#8217;s
way and where he could make use of his
eyes. Thus it came about that he observed
several interesting facts.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Friestone and Nora made up the
whole force of the store, which did a considerable
trade in groceries and articles
such as a village community needs. Furthermore,
the abundant and excellent stock
showed that the owner was not only enterprising
but understood her business. The
other store in Beartown hardly rose to the
dignity of a rival.
</p>
<p>It may as well be said at this point
that her husband, who had been dead six
years, went through the whole war for the
Union and was badly wounded several
times. President Grant personally complimented
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Captain Friestone for his bravery
in battle, and when he became President
appointed him as postmaster at Beartown.
He suffered so grievously from his
old wounds that the small post office and
his pension were all that saved him and
his young wife from actual want. He took
up storekeeping in a small way, gradually
branching out until he had established a
flourishing business, whereupon he did an
almost unheard of thing. As soon as he
knew his future was secure, he notified the
government that he would no longer accept
a pension and he stuck to the resolution.
</p>
<p>The veteran was retained in office by
the successors of President Grant until his
death, when the appointment was given to
his widow, not a member of the community
asking for a change. The income
was meagre, but the widow had become
accustomed to the duties, having performed
them during the last years of her
husband&#8217;s life, and she liked the work.
The store paid so well that it more than
met the wants of the two.
</p>
<p>When the cheering thousands welcomed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
the soldiers returning from the war, a
proud father held his little girl on his
shoulder and she waved her hand joyously
to the bronzed heroes some of whom were
still little more than boys. One laughing
soldier snatched away the child and kissed
her. He was Captain Friestone and the
girl was Bessie Elton. The acquaintance
thus begun ripened until the time arrived
for her to put on long dresses, and by and
by she became the happy bride of the
officer, and never a shadow darkened their
hearthstone until Death called and took
away the brave husband and father.
</p>
<p>Mike noticed that a massive safe stood
behind the counter in a corner at the rear
of the store. The ponderous door was
open, for mother and daughter had frequent
cause to use the repository. Within the
steel structure all the stamps, government
funds and daily cash receipts were deposited
at the close of the day&#8217;s business. The
value of these was slight, but the safe
contained a great deal more. While Nora
was lighting the five kerosene lamps, suspended
on brackets at favorable points in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the store, a middle aged and somewhat
corpulent man bustled in, nodded to the
widow and handed her a large sealed envelope.
Mike heard him say, &#8220;Twenty-five
hundred,&#8221; and she replied &#8220;Very well.&#8221;
It was evident that he had brought in
that amount of money and left if for
security with her. On the back of the
envelope&mdash;though of course the youth did
not see this&mdash;was written in a large, round
hand, &#8220;C. Jasper, $2500.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The widow walked to the rear of the
store, drew out one of the small central
drawers of the safe and placed the big
envelope in it, still leaving the heavy door
open, though the little drawer was locked
with a tiny key.
</p>
<p>Five minutes later, a second man, thin,
nervous and alert, stepped through the
door, glanced sharply around and passed
a similar envelope to the woman. On the
back of it was written, &#8220;G. H. Kupfer&mdash;$1250.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will please give me a receipt,&#8221; he
said in his brisk fashion. The reply was
gentle:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? It&#8217;s simple business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Kupfer, because you have more
faith in my safe than in your small one,
you bring your money to me. I have not
asked it; I should rather not have it, and
I do it only to accommodate you, besides
which I charge you nothing. If burglars
should break in and steal your money, I
cannot be responsible. Do I make that
clear to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Friestone, I have no fear
of that sort; I only ask that you give me
a receipt merely as a matter of record and
to save you possible annoyance. Suppose
anything should happen to me&mdash;such as
my death&mdash;my folks would be put to great
trouble to get this money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That cannot possibly occur, for your
name and the amount are written on the
sealed envelope; I know every member of
your family, and in the event you speak of
I should hand it personally to some one
of them. On no other condition will I
take your money for safe keeping. Follow
your own pleasure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; replied the caller, with a
nervous laugh, &#8220;have it as you please.
I have left money with you before and
haven&#8217;t suffered. But say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the keen eyes flitted around the store,
he saw Mike Murphy sitting under one of
the lamps and looking as if he was not
listening to their conversation. Mr. Kupfer
leaned over the counter and lowered his
voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A young gentleman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like his looks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I advise you not to look at him,&#8221;
was the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is he going to hang round the
store?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just so long as it suits his pleasure to
do so. He and two of his friends are going
to take supper and stay overnight with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about the two?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen them, and I never
saw this young gentleman till this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The caller turned his face and scanned
Mike more closely. The youth, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
boiling with anger, tried to look as if
unaware of the insulting action.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please hand that package back,&#8221; said
Mr. Kupfer, with a compression of his
thin lips.
</p>
<p>Without a word, the widow passed the
envelope to the man, who whisked through
the open door, fairly leaping off the porch
to the dusty path.
</p>
<p>Who shall describe the emotions of Mike
Murphy during these exasperating moments?
He recalled the experience of
Alvin and Chester, as they related it to
him, when they were arrested as post
office robbers some days before, and now
something similar in essence had come to
him. But what could he do? He would
have liked to pummel the one who had
insulted him, but that was impracticable,
inasmuch as he had not addressed any
words to the youth.
</p>
<p>While he was fuming and glaring at the
door through which the man had disappeared,
Mike heard a soft chuckle behind
him. He whisked his head around and
saw Nora standing beside the safe just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
back of him, stuffing her handkerchief in
her mouth and with her face almost as
crimson as his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I may be so bowld I should like to
know what ye are laughing at,&#8221; said Mike,
who could feel no resentment toward the
merry young miss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We both heard what he said,&#8221; she
replied as soon as she could command her
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Being I faal like a firecracker that has
jest been teched off, I suspict I caught his
loving remarks consarning mesilf.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me something truly&mdash;upon
your word of honor&mdash;take your dying
oath?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will, ye may depind upon the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a real post office robber?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Hostesses and Guests</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Mike affected to be greatly embarrassed
by the question of Nora
Friestone. He swallowed what
seemed to be a lump rising in his throat,
grinned in a sickly way and then asked as
if much distressed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do ye insist on me answering yer
quistion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she replied, with an expression
of tremendous solemnity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll hev to own that I&#8217;m the
champion post office robber in Maine. It
was mesilf that plundered three offices,
each a hundred miles from the ither, on
the same night and burned up an old man,
his wife and siven children that vintured
to dispoot me will. I&#8217;ve been in the bus&#8217;ness
iver since the year one and me home
is Murthersville at the head of Murthersville
Creek in Murthersville County.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rising from his chair, Mike bowed low.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thrust I have answered yer quistions
satisfactorily, Miss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have done better&mdash;hello,
Jim!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This salutation was to a big gawky boy,
who slouched through the door, with the
announcement:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m ready: what shall I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s yer frind?&#8221; asked Mike of Nora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He comes round each morning to take
out and place the things on the porch in
front and brings them in again each evening&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Mike, addressing the gaping
youngster, &#8220;ye&#8217;re discharged fur to-night.
I&#8217;m doing yer job for the avening, but you
git your wages just the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With which Mike thrust his hand into
his trousers pocket and drew out one of
the three silver quarters there, handing it
to the boy, who was too mystified to understand
what it meant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws,&#8221; he said, with a silly grin, looking
at the coin and then clasping it tight;
&#8220;what do yuh warnt me to dew?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go right home to yer mommy and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
give her that quarter to save up fur ye.
Don&#8217;t git gay on the road and buy a horse
and wagon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws, but&mdash;uh&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand
what yuh am drivin&#8217; at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t understand anything in this
wurruld and by yer looks niver will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He means, Jim,&#8221; interposed Nora, &#8220;that
he will bring in the things to-night for us,
but you must come round in the morning
and set them out again. That&#8217;s plain
enough, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws&mdash;but what did he give me so
much money fur? I hain&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;
to earn it; I don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know that. Come wid me,
James.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Mike spoke, he slipped his arm under
that of Jim and walked to the door, not
pausing until they stood on the porch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, James, tell me where ye live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws, what fur?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I asked ye; out wid it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lad pointed a crooked finger down the
street to the left.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see how quick ye can git thar.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
Don&#8217;t look back, and whin ye tumbles over
the doorsill, tell yer mither ye won&#8217;t have
any wurruk to do here until to-morrer
mornin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yaws, I understand&mdash;why didn&#8217;t ye
say so afore?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause ye wouldn&#8217;t have understood if
I did. Off wid ye!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And to make sure of being obeyed, Mike
gave him a push which caused his dilapidated
straw hat to fall off. He snatched
it up and broke into a lope, as if afraid of
harm if he lingered longer in the neighborhood
of such strange doings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Nora, if ye&#8217;ll tell me where
ye want these things placed, I shall be
honored by carrying &#8217;em in fur ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike stood in the front door and looked
down the big store to Nora, at the rear,
who called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Set them in the back part of the room
right here where I&#8217;m standing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I put &#8217;em there, if ye stand
there?&#8221; asked Mike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect to get out of your way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yaws,&#8221; remarked the youth, mimicking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Jim, who had shown so much mental
bewilderment.
</p>
<p>The task was easy. There were picks,
shovels, rakes, hoes, spades, pails, ice cream
freezers, toy wagons with gilt letters, coils
of rope and the various articles displayed
by most village or country stores to attract
custom. These were carried in by
the lusty Mike, a half dozen at a time, and
set down somewhat loosely at the rear,
Nora making a few suggestions that were
hardly needed.
</p>
<p>While this was going on, the mother
employed herself in locking the safe for
the night. It will be remembered that in
addition to the stamps and money belonging
to the government and to herself, a
liberal amount was already there, the property
of one of the leading citizens of Beartown,
who was glad to entrust it to the
keeping of the honest widow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the daughter when Mike
had completed his work, which took only
a few minutes, &#8220;you have earned your
supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now what reward can equal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
the light of yer blue eyes and the swate
smile that shows the purtiest teeth in the
State of Maine?&#8221; was the instant inquiry
in return.
</p>
<p>The mother had just finished locking the
safe, and, standing up, she laughed in her
gentle way and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you have kissed the blarney
stone, Mike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have done the same had the
chance been mine, which it wasn&#8217;t. Is
there any more play that ye call wurruk
which I can do fur the likes of ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more, thank you. Nora and
I will now close the store and attend to
preparing supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll bring me frinds to enj&#8217;y the
same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Mike bade them good night for a
brief while, and strode down the road to
find Alvin and Chester, whom, as you know,
he met on their way to look for him. The
three lingered and chatted, with the view
of giving mother and daughter time in
which to make ready the evening meal.
</p>
<p>Following a common fashion of the times,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
the veteran Carter Friestone, in building
his store and home, made the second story
the living room of the family. It could be
reached by the stairs at the back of the
regular entrance, being through a narrow
hall where visitors rang a bell when they
called.
</p>
<p>The upper front apartment served for
parlor and sitting room, and was neatly
furnished, one of the principal articles
being a piano. This was a birthday present
to Nora, who was gifted with a naturally
sweet voice and received instruction from
the schoolmistress of Beartown. At the
rear was the kitchen and dining room, with
two bedrooms between that and the parlor,
facing each other across the hall.
</p>
<p>Nora answered the tinkle of the bell,
and Alvin and Chester were introduced to
her under the light of the hanging lamp
overhead. The little party found the
mother awaiting them at the head of the
stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper will be ready in a few minutes,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Nora will entertain you in the
parlor until I call you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>The girl escorted them to the front room,
where all sat down and chatted with the
cheery good nature proper in such a party
of young folks. Mike was at his best,
and kept all laughing by his drollery.
Nora&#8217;s merriment filled the room with
music. Michael had given his name soon
after his entrance into the store, but insisted
that the way to pronounce it was &#8220;Mike,&#8221;
not &#8220;Michael.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew such a funny person,&#8221;
said Nora, after one of his quaint remarks.
&#8220;Mother and I took to him from the first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it&#8217;s a common wakeness whereiver
I go,&#8221; said Mike gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We find him fairly good company,&#8221;
said Alvin. &#8220;He seems to have been born
that way and we can hardly blame him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He tries our patience very much,&#8221;
added Chester, &#8220;but we have learned to
bear the affliction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you all lived in Beartown,&#8221;
said Nora impulsively, &#8220;and that Mike
would call to see us every day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisht, now,&#8221; said he, lowering his
voice. &#8220;Whin I strolled through the town
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
on me arrival, I was so chaarmed I began
hunting fur a house and property to buy
fur me home. I sthruck the right spot and
made an offer to the owner of the same.
I think we&#8217;ll come to tarms, being there&#8217;s
only a difference of a thrifle of five or six
thousand dollars in the price.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Friestone now appeared with word
that supper was waiting, and all passed
into the kitchen and dining room. Of
course she presided, Nora acting as waitress
whenever necessary. Alvin and Chester
complimented their hostess on the excellence
of the meal, while Mike was so
extravagant in his praise that they protested.
Alvin told the particulars of their
trip in the launch from home to Wiscasset
and return, omitting of course all reference
to Stockham Calvert that would give a
hint of his profession and his purpose in
making what looked like an aimless ramble
through this portion of Maine. The Captain
was assured that his boat would not
be disturbed where it lay moored under
the bank, and he and Chester gave no
further thought to it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>The group lingered long at the table,
and at the close of the meal Nora preceded
them to the parlor, were she excused
herself in order to help her mother in washing
the dishes and clearing away things.
The work was finished sooner than the
friends expected, and the happy party gathered
in the parlor.
</p>
<p>The presence of the musical instrument
made its own suggestion, and the lads
insisted that Nora should favor them with
a song or two. She had the good taste to
comply after a modest protest, and gave
them a treat. Her voice, as I have said,
was of fine quality though rather weak,
and she sang several of the popular songs
of the day with exquisite expression. She
was so warmly applauded that she blushed
and sang again until it was evident to all
she was tired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said she as she rose from the
stool and looked at Mike, &#8220;you must sing
for us, for I know you can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mike, show them what you
can do in that line,&#8221; joined Alvin, and
Chester was equally urgent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>He objected and held back, but when
Mrs. Friestone joined in the request he
rose reluctantly and went to the instrument.
</p>
<p>And straightway came the surprise of
the evening.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>An Incident on Shipboard</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Among the passengers on one of the
most magnificent of ocean steamers
that crossed the Atlantic during the
summer of which I have made mention,
was a famous prima donna coming to the
United States to fulfil a contract which
would net her many thousand dollars.
This notable artist who possessed a most
winning personality as well as great beauty
was easily the most popular passenger
aboard the steamer on that memorable trip
across the ocean.
</p>
<p>One evening this lady was strolling over
the promenade deck under the escort of
her brother. The night was unusually
calm, with a bright moon in the sky. The
mighty throbbing structure glided over the
sleeping billows as across a millpond, and
all were in fine spirits, for they were nearing
home, and that dreadful affliction <i>mal de mer</i>
had troubled only the abnormally sensitive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Neither the brother nor the prima donna
had felt the slightest effects.
</p>
<p>The two were chatting of many things,
but nothing of any importance, when she
suddenly stopped with an exclamation of
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; she added when they had
stood motionless for a few seconds; &#8220;do
you hear that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do; it is wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the voice of some one singing
&#8220;Mavourneen,&#8221; that sweet Irish melody
which has charmed and will always charm
thousands. It came from the second class
section, which was separated from the first
by two gates. These marked the &#8220;impassable
chasm,&#8221; so far as the less favored
were concerned, though of course the first
class passengers were free to wander whither
they chose.
</p>
<p>The lady and gentleman walked to the
barrier and looked across.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; said the man, in a low
tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked his companion, with
eager curiosity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To the right, in front of that group
which has gathered round him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him now. Why, he is only a boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty big one. But hark!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They ceased talking that they might
not lose any of the marvellous music.
Others gathered near until more than a
score were listening near the bridge. Many
more paused in different parts of the deck,
and even the grim captain high up on the
bridge expressed the opinion that the singer&#8217;s
voice was &#8220;infernally good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The singer was modest, for when he discovered
the number of listeners he abruptly
ceased nor could any coaxing induce him
to resume the treat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Louis,&#8221; said the prima donna, after
the silence had lasted some minutes and
the various groups began dissolving, &#8220;I
want you to bring that boy to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, my dear, he is a second class
passenger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that? He has a divine gift
in his voice. I must meet him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Louis shrugged his shoulders, but he
was used to the whims of his brilliant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
sister. He strolled through one of the
gates while she awaited his return. He
soon appeared, walking slowly, in order to
keep pace with a big boy behind him, who,
it was evident, moved with deep reluctance.
Louis led him straight to the lady, who
advanced a step to meet him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to shake hands with you,&#8221; she
said in her frank, winning manner, &#8220;and
to tell you how much we all enjoyed your
singing of &#8216;Mavourneen.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The confused lad doffed his cap and
bowed with awkward grace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was mesilf that feared I was disturbing
yer slumbers, which if it be the
fact I beg yer pardon fur the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Disturbing our slumbers! Did you hear
that, Louis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the artist&#8217;s musical laughter rang
out. More soberly she asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me your name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike Murphy&mdash;not Michael as some
ignorant persons call it&mdash;and I&#8217;m from Tipperary,
in the County of Tipperary, and the
town is a hundred miles from Dublin&mdash;thank
ye kindly, leddy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike was standing with his cap in hand
where the moonlight revealed his homely
face and his shock of red hair. His self-possession
had quickly come back to him
and his waggishness could not be repressed.
He glanced into the beautiful face before
him and made answer:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I be alone, whin I&#8217;m standing
in the prisence of the swatest lady on
boord the steamer, wid her father at her
elbow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>How the prima donna laughed!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Louis, he thinks you are my father,
when you are my twin brother! It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be for you, but not for me,&#8221;
he grimly answered, though scarcely less
pleased than she over the pointed compliment
to her.
</p>
<p>Addressing Mike, the lady said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a wonderfully fine tenor
voice: do you know that, Mike?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do <i>now</i>, since yersilf has told me,
though ye make me blush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you travelling alone?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss; I&#8217;m on me way to jine me
dad and mither, which the same live in
the State of Maine, of which I suppose
yersilf has heerd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you had any instruction in music
or the cultivation of your voice?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only insthrumint on which I can
play is the jewsharp, and folks that hear
me always kindly requists me to have done
as soon as I begin. As to me v&#8217;ice, the
cultivation I&#8217;ve resaved has been in shouting
at the cows when they wint astray or
at the pigs whin they broke out of the stye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to become an opera
singer, Mike?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He recoiled, and, though he knew the
meaning of the question, he asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And phwat does ye mane by &#8216;opera&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you know, you sly boy. I am sure
that after a few years of training you can
make your fortune on the operatic stage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The assurance did not appeal to Mike.
He must find some excuse for declining an
offer which would have turned the heads of
most persons.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you, leddy, and I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
sorry I can&#8217;t accipt, as Terence Gallagher
said whin the mob invited him out to be
hanged.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye see, me dad, if he lives long enough
will be eighty-odd years owld, and me
mither is alriddy that feeble she can hardly
walk across the floor of our cabin, and I
am naaded at home to take care of the two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let that go for the present. I
wish you to come and see me to-morrow at
ten o&#8217;clock. Will you do so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I refoos?&#8221; asked Mike, who
would have been glad to back out. &#8220;Who
is it that I shall ask fur whin I vinture on
this part of the boat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She gave him her name, thanked him
for the meeting and bade him good night.
Mike donned his cap and returned to his
acquaintances, to whom he told a portion
of what had taken place.
</p>
<p>Dressed in his best, his obdurate hair
smoothed down by dousing it in water and
threading a brush many times through it,
and spotlessly clean, Mike with many misgivings
crossed the bridge the next morning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
into the more favored section of the steamer.
He did not have to make inquiries for the
lady, for she stood smilingly at the end of
the first class promenade awaiting him.
She extended her dainty gloved hand, and
the lad, who had braced himself for the
ordeal, had shed most of his awkwardness.
The brother kept in the background, having
been ordered to do so, but he amusedly
watched the two from a distance, as did
a good many others.
</p>
<p>The prima donna conducted Mike straight
to the grand saloon and sat down before
the superb piano. Others sauntered into
the room to listen and look and enjoy.
</p>
<p>The frightened Mike hung back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand right here beside me,&#8221; she said
with pleasant imperiousness. &#8220;I will play
the accompaniment while you sing &#8216;Mavourneen.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m that scared, me leddy, that I
couldn&#8217;t sing a word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut&mdash;none of that. Come, try!&#8221;
and she struck several notes on the instrument.
</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s voice was a trifle uncertain at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
first, but she knew how to encourage him,
and soon the tones rang out with the
exquisite sweetness that had charmed the
listeners the evening before. When with
many doubts he finished, he was startled
by a vigorous handclapping that caused
him to look round. Fully fifty men and
women had gathered without his suspecting
it. He bowed and was turning to walk to
a chair, when the lady stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not through yet; I must test
your voice further. Can you sing any other
songs?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thried a few.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Name them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t ricollect them at this moment,
but there&#8217;s &#8216;Oft in the Stilly Night&#8217; and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do; it is one of Tom Moore&#8217;s
prettiest. Are you ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the fast increasing audience applauded
to the echo. Other pieces followed
until the prima donna allowed him to rest.
Then sitting down beside him, she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I told you last night, you have a
fortune in your voice. If you can arrange
to leave your feeble parents to the care of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
others, you can soon earn enough to keep
them in comfort all their lives. If you can
come to Boston or New York when I sing
there, you must not fail to call on me and
to attend the concert. Here is my card.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had already written a few lines upon
the pasteboard which made it an open
sesame to the possessor to any and all of
her concerts. Mike thanked her gratefully,
and had to promise to come to see
her again before the steamer reached New
York, and to think over her proposal. He
kept his promise so far as calling on her
again, not once but several times before
she bade him good-by on the pier.
</p>
<p>But, as I have said, there was nothing
in her plan that appealed to the Irish
youth. The modest fellow never told of
the occurrence to anyone, nor did he
give it more than a passing thought in
the weeks and months that followed. The
brother of the prima donna imparted the
particulars to his intimate friend Gideon
Landon, the wealthy banker, and in this
way I am able to relate the incident on
shipboard.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Night Shall be Filled with Music</span>&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The prima donna who grew so fond
of Mike discovered several interesting
facts about him, aside from his
marvellous tenor voice. He had the talent
of improvisation. When they became well
enough acquainted for him to feel at ease
in her presence, he sang bits of melody
that were his own composition. She was
delighted and encouraged him to cultivate
the gift. Of course he knew nothing about
playing any instrument, but under her instruction
he quickly picked up the art of
accompanying himself on the piano. The
music which he sang was of the simplest
nature and the chords suggested themselves
to his ear.
</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of the lad was that,
despite his exuberant, rollicking nature, he
had no taste for humorous music. When
she asked him to sing a lively song, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
shook his head. He not only knew none,
but had no wish to learn any. His liking
was for sentiment and tenderness of feeling.
Moore&#8217;s melodies were his favorites and
he knew few others. At the last meeting
of Mike and the lady she gave him a
fragment of verse which she had cut from
a paper and asked him to compose a melody
for it. He promised to try.
</p>
<p>With this rather lengthy explanation, and
the fact that neither Alvin Landon nor
Chester Haynes had ever heard him sing,
though both had noticed that his voice
was peculiarly clear, you will understand
the surprise that awaited them when he
walked to the piano and reluctantly sat
down. The hoarseness which followed his
shouting when marooned on White Islands
was gone and his notes were as clear as a
bell.
</p>
<p>Every one expected a mirth-provoking
song when he placed his foot on the pedal
and his fingers touched the keys. Even
Widow Friestone smiled in anticipation,
while Alvin and Chester feared that in his
ignorance of true singing his attempts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
would become comical to the last degree.
The listeners glanced significantly to one
another, while he was bringing out a few
preliminary notes.
</p>
<p>Suddenly into the room burst the most
ravishing music from the sweetest voice
they had ever heard.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;The harp that once through Tara&#8217;s halls</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>The soul of music shed,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Now hangs as mute on Tara&#8217;s walls</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>As if that soul were fled.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>So sleeps the pride of former days,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>So glory&#8217;s thrill is o&#8217;er,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>And hearts that once beat high for praise,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2em;'>Now feel that pulse no more.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>With the same bewitching sweetness he
sang the remaining stanza, and then paused
with his fingers idly rambling over the keys,
as if in doubt what next to do.
</p>
<p>There was no applause. Not a person
moved or seemed to breathe. Then Alvin
and Chester looked wonderingly at each
other, as if doubting their own senses.
Whoever imagined that Mike Murphy was
gifted with so wonderful a voice? It seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
as if they were dreaming and were waiting
for the spell to lift.
</p>
<p>It would have been affectation on the
part of Mike to pretend he was ignorant
of the effect he had produced. He had
seen it too often in the past, and he knew
the great songstress on the steamer would
not have said what she did had there not
been good basis therefor. So, without
seeming to notice the hush&mdash;the most
sincere tribute possible&mdash;he sang the old
favorite &#8220;Mavourneen,&#8221; and at its conclusion
&#8220;Annie Laurie,&#8221; with a liquidity
of tone that was never surpassed by throat
of nightingale.
</p>
<p>At its conclusion he swung round on the
stool, sprang up and dropped into the nearest
chair, looking about as if doubtful of
the reception that was to attend his efforts.
</p>
<p>Nora was the first to rally. She uttered
one ecstatic &#8220;Oh!&#8221; bounded across the
floor, threw her dimpled arms about his
neck and kissed him on the cheek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling! You sing like an angel!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could be sweeter,&#8221; added the
smiling mother. Mike gently kissed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
girl on her forehead, and did not release
her until she drew away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;re very kind. It&#8217;s mesilf is glad me
efforts seemed to plaise ye, though I&#8217;m in
doubt as to the Captain and second mate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin walked silently across the floor
and reached out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to know ye,&#8221; replied Mike, with
a grin, looking up in the face that had
actually turned slightly pale. &#8220;What is yer
name, plaise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester joined his chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike, Alvin and I were silent, for we
didn&#8217;t know what to say. You have
given us the surprise of our lives. I am
no singer and never can be, but I would
give a hundred thousand dollars, if I had
it, for your voice. Alvin makes some pretensions.
He is the leader of his school
quartette, but he can&#8217;t equal you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Equal him!&#8221; sniffed the Captain. &#8220;If
Mike ever shows himself where our quartette
is trying to sing, I shall make every
one shut up to save ourselves from disgrace.
As for Mike, we&#8217;ll give him the
choice to sing for us or to be killed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Chester asked reprovingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you let us know about
this before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye didn&#8217;t ask me, and what could be
the difference if ye didn&#8217;t find it out? Ye
wouldn&#8217;t have larned the same if Nora and
her mither hadn&#8217;t insisted that I should
entertain them, as I tried to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a queer make-up,&#8221; replied
Alvin, with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since ye are the leader, Captain, of yer
quartette at school, it&#8217;s up to ye to obleege
the company wid something in their line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nora added her entreaties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know you can do very well, Alvin,
though of course not half so well as Mike,
for <i>nobody</i> can do that,&#8221; was the naïve
argument of the miss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Alvin emphatically, and,
assuming deep solemnity, he raised his
hand. &#8220;I vow that I will never, never sing
in Mike&#8217;s presence. I can stand a joke as
well as most persons, but that is the limit.
Here&#8217;s Chester, however. He will be glad
to give Mike a few lessons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fun of it was that Chester could not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
sing the chromatic scale correctly if his life
were at stake. He was not rattled by the
request.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike, can you play the accompaniment
to &#8216;Greenville&#8217;?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How does it go? Hum the same fur
me so I can catch it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester stood up and &#8220;hummed,&#8221; but
without the slightest resemblance to any
tune that the others had ever heard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That gits me,&#8221; commented Mike, &#8220;as
Teddy O&#8217;Rourke said whin the p&#8217;liceman
grabbed him. If ye&#8217;ll sthrike in I&#8217;ll do my
best to keep wid ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; I decline to play second fiddle
to anyone,&#8221; and Chester resumed his seat
as if in high dudgeon.
</p>
<p>At this moment Nora asked of Mike:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever make up music for yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have tried once or twice, but didn&#8217;t
do much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please sing us something of your
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A leddy on the steamer that brought
me over give me some printed words one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
day wid the requist that I should try to
put some music to &#8217;em. I furgot the
same till after she had gone, but I&#8217;ll make
the effort if ye all won&#8217;t be too hard on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>(This was the only reference that Mike
was ever heard to make to the incidents
recorded in the previous chapter.)
</p>
<p>And then the Irish lad sang &#8220;The Sweet
Long Ago.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Knock at the Door</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Alvin easily caught the swing of
the bass and sang when the chorus
was reached. Mike barely touched
the keys, bringing out a few faint chords
that could not add to the sweetness of his
voice. Mrs. Friestone sat motionless, looking
intently at him until he came to the
last words. Then she abruptly took off her
glasses and put her handkerchief to her
eyes.
</p>
<p>The sweet long ago! Again she saw the
handsome, sturdy youth when he returned
from the war for the defence of his country,
as brave, as resolute, as aflame with patriotism
as in his earlier years, but with
frame wrenched by painful wounds. Their
lives were inexpressibly happy from the
time she became a bride, and their maturer
age was blessed by the gift of darling Nora.
Existence became one grand sweet dream&mdash;more
happy, more radiant and more a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
foretaste of what awaited them all in the
great beyond. That loved form had vanished
in the sweet long ago, but the memory
could never fade or grow dim.
</p>
<p>It was the song that brought back the
picture with a vividness it had not worn
for many a year. The tears would come,
and Nora, glancing at her mother, buried
her face in her own handkerchief and
sobbed. Alvin and Chester sat silent, and
Mike, turning gently on the stool, looked
sympathetically at mother and daughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mike,&#8221; came a soft, choking
voice from behind the snowy bit of linen,
and the brave lad winked rapidly and fought
back the tears that crowded into his honest
eyes.
</p>
<p>It was not strange that the effect of
Mike Murphy&#8217;s beautiful singing of the
touching songs brooded like a benison
throughout the evening. Even Nora, when
asked to favor them again, shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not after Mike,&#8221; she replied, her eyes
gleaming more brightly through the moisture
not yet dried.
</p>
<p>It was impossible for the Irish lad to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
restrain his humor, and soon he had them
all smiling, but there was no loud laughter
such as greeted his first sallies, and the conversation
as a whole was soberer and more
thoughtful. Alvin and Chester told of
their school experiences, and finally Mike
related his adventure when marooned on
the lonely island well out toward the Atlantic
and his friends found him after they
had given him up as drowned.
</p>
<p>So the evening wore away until, at a
seasonable hour, the head of the household
said that when they wished to retire she
would show them to their room. Just
then Mike had his hand over his mouth
in the effort to repress a yawn. Nora
laughingly pointed at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a few minutes he&#8217;ll be asleep and will
tumble off his chair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afeard ye&#8217;re right, as I replied to
me tacher whin he obsarved that I was
the biggest numskull in Tipperary County.
Come, Captain and sicond mate&mdash;ye won&#8217;t
forgit, Miss Nora, that I&#8217;m <i>first</i> mate of
the battleship <i>Deerfut</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl went to the kitchen from which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
she speedily returned, carrying a hand
lamp, which she gave to her mother. She
nodded to the lads, who followed her to the
door of the apartment assigned them for
the night. They entered behind her as
she set the light on the stand and turned
about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will find everything as you
wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be itherwise, whin it&#8217;s yersilf
that has provided the same. Be that
token, we&#8217;re getting more than we desarve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could be finer,&#8221; added Alvin,
glancing round the lighted room. &#8220;It&#8217;s as
neat as a pin and we shall sleep the sleep
of the just.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three had noticed when in the parlor
the portrait suspended in the place of
honor. The blue uniform, the military
cap resting on one knee, and the strong,
expressive face told their own story. It
was the picture of Captain Carter Friestone,
taken many a year before, when
in the flush of his patriotic young manhood.
A smaller picture was on the wall of the
bedroom of mother and daughter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>The chamber which the lads entered
was graced with two small, inexpensive
pictures of a religious character, a pretty
rug covered most of the floor, the walls
were tastefully papered and there were
several chairs, to say nothing of the mirror,
stand and other conveniences.
</p>
<p>Not only was the broad bed with its
snowy counterpane and downy pillows
roomy enough for two, but a wide cot
had been placed on the other side of the
neat little room for whoever chose to sleep
upon it.
</p>
<p>That which caught the eye of the three
was a musket leaning in the far corner.
Chester stepped across, and asking permission
of Mrs. Friestone, picked it up and
brought it over to where the light was
stronger. He saw it was a Springfield
rifle, but the lock and base of the barrel
were torn into gaping rents.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose this belonged to the captain,&#8221;
said Chester inquiringly. The widow
nodded her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it did good service&mdash;that is certain,&#8221;
added Chester, with his companions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
beside him scrutinizing the weapon. &#8220;But
it seems to have been injured.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Carter brought it home from the war,
declaring it was better than when new.
He put a double charge in one Fourth of
July morning, forgetting that the weapon
was much worn from many previous firings.
It exploded at the lock and came
very near killing him. But,&#8221; she added,
with a sigh, &#8220;it is very precious to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of that,&#8221; said Chester as he
reverently carried the gun back to the
corner.
</p>
<p>The good woman kissed each lad on the
forehead. When she thus saluted Mike,
who was the last, she placed her thin hand
on his head, and said with infinite tenderness:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for what you did to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg ye don&#8217;t mintion it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike stopped abruptly, and pretending
to see something interesting in the old
rifle, hurried across the room to examine
it more closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night and pleasant dreams,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
called the lady as she passed out, noiselessly
closing the door behind her.
</p>
<p>It having been agreed that Mike should
use the cot, the three prepared for retiring,
the mind of each full of the experience of
the evening. Both Alvin and Chester
wished to speak of the extraordinary voice
of Mike, but neither did, for they knew
he would prefer they should not. He could
not help knowing how greatly he had been
favored by nature, and disliked any reminder.
</p>
<p>The wick of the lamp was turned down
and blown out by Alvin, after glancing
around and noting that his companions
were ready. Through the raised window,
opening over a broad alley, the cool wind
stole. It so came about that for several
days and nights, including the one of which
I am now speaking, the leading cities of
the country, embracing even Boston, were
suffering from one of the most intense heat
waves that ever swept like a furnace blast
over most of the States in the Union.
But in favored southern Maine it was
ideally cool. You could stand a thin covering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
at night, or you could cast it aside.
You were equally comfortable in either
situation.
</p>
<p>Our young friends ought to have sunk
into a sound sleep within a few minutes
after lying down, but they did not. Something
was on their minds, and the singular
fact of it was that the thoughts of each
were identically the same, though as yet
not a hint had been dropped by anyone.
</p>
<p>It was Mike who abruptly spoke:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Captain, are ye aslaap?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to be, but I was never wider
awake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the second mate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same here,&#8221; was the reply from
that individual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to obsarve that I&#8217;m engaged
just now in thinking, byes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking of what?&#8221; asked Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Spose them post office robbers should
pay this place a visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world put that in your
head?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the same thought come to ye,
Captain?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I must admit it did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is it with the second mate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has troubled me, too, Mike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can see no real cause for misgiving,&#8221;
added Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know the <i>Water Witch</i> is somewhere
in the neighborhood,&#8221; remarked Chester,
to which his chum replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What could attract them to a small
office like this? They hunt for bigger
game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good lot of money in the safe
downstairs,&#8221; said Mike. &#8220;&#8217;Twas mesilf
that obsarved one of the leddy&#8217;s callers
gave her twinty-five hundred dollars, which
she put away. Where could the spalpeens
make a bigger haul?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how should they know about it?
They didn&#8217;t see it done,&#8221; said Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist, now! From what me eyes told
me, the same being anither chap called
and would have lift more, had he not been
afeard of me eagle eye that was on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it show that it&#8217;s the practice
in Beartown wid some of them as has lots
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
of money to lave the same wid the leddy?
Thim chaps are prying round and it would
be aisy fur &#8217;em to larn the fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We should have seen something of them
if they were in this village.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin felt the weakness of this statement,
for such unwelcome visitors would
be too shrewd to expose themselves to discovery
when it was possible to avoid it.
All three might have been in Beartown for
hours without drawing attention to themselves
and without giving Mike, during his
earlier visit, a glimpse of them.
</p>
<p>Speculating in this manner, Alvin and
Mike came to the belief, or rather hope,
that their good friend was in no danger
of a burglarious visit. Chester would not
be convinced, but expressed the hope that
they were right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall make bold to remind Mrs. Friestone
in the morning of the risk she runs
and advise her to cease accepting any outside
deposits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester was the last to fall asleep. It
was a long time before he sank into slumber,
but by and by he glided into the realm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
of dreams. He had no means of knowing
how long he lay unconscious, when he
gradually became aware of a peculiar tapping
somewhere near. A moment&#8217;s listening
told him that someone was knocking
on the door.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Visitors of the Night</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Chester bounded out of bed and
hunted to the door, which he unlocked
and opened for a few inches.
He could see nothing in the gloom, and
asked in a whisper:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I&mdash;Nora. Mamma and I are
awfully scared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody is in the store downstairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma heard the window raised and
woke me. She asked me to call you boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment and we&#8217;ll be with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It showed how lightly Alvin and Mike
were sleeping when they were instantly
roused by the slight noise made in opening
the door. Each sat on the side of his
couch and listened. In the deep silence
they heard the snatch of conversation and
hurriedly began putting on their clothes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
They wrought silently and without lighting
the lamp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected it,&#8221; remarked Chester, imitating
them.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Friestone joined her daughter in
the dark hall, she being too wise to use a
light. A moment later the whole party
stood together in the gloom, where neither
could see the face of the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; whispered the mother.
</p>
<p>The five stood for a minute without stirring
or speaking and hardly breathing.
Not the slightest sound reached their ears.
Then Chester asked in a guarded undertone:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you were not mistaken,
Mrs. Friestone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not have been; the sound of
the raising of the window was too distinct
for me to be deceived&mdash;hark!&#8221; she warned
again.
</p>
<p>This time all heard something. It was
a faint, rasping noise such as might have
been caused by the cautious pushing of a
box or large smooth object over the floor.
If this were so, the article could not have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
been moved more than a few inches, for
the sound ceased immediately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Alvin; &#8220;you have
visitors. About what time do you suppose
it is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The clock struck twelve quite awhile
ago. There! it is now one,&#8221; she added as
a silvery tinkle came from the parlor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Nora, echoing
the question that was in the mind of
every one.
</p>
<p>And then a strange council was held in
a place so dark that all who took part
were mutually invisible.
</p>
<p>It would seem that the common sense
course was to make a noise that would be
heard by the burglars and would scare
them off. That is to say that theoretically
this would occur, but it might not. Knowing
how much loot was within their reach,
if not already in hand, one or two of them
were likely to hurry upstairs and compel
those that were there to hold their peace,
hesitating at no violence to enforce their
orders.
</p>
<p>While the boys were eager to take the risk,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
the mother would not agree and the plan
had to be abandoned.
</p>
<p>The next proposal was for each to thrust
his or her head out of a window and call
for help. The cry would rouse the village
and it would not take long for many citizens
to rush thither. Beartown had no police
force, the only officer of the peace being a
constable who was lame and cross-eyed
and lived at the farthest end of the village.
No dependence could be placed on him, but
there were plenty of others who would
gladly hasten to the help of mother and
daughter.
</p>
<p>This was the only thing to do, and it
would have been done but for the hysterical
opposition of Nora Friestone. She declared
that the dreadful robbers&mdash;she was sure of
it&mdash;would hurry upstairs the instant the
first scream was made and kill every one
before any help could arrive! It might not
take more than five or ten minutes for
friends to run to the spot, but that would
be enough for the burglars to complete
their awful work.
</p>
<p>Possibly the girl might have been argued
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
out of her absurd fear had she not won her
mother to her side. She took the same view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What then is to be done?&#8221; asked Chester
a trifle impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing; they can&#8217;t get the safe open,
if they work till daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They can do it in a few minutes if they
use dynamite, and at the same time blow
out the whole end of your house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To this terrifying declaration the lady
could make no reply except to say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well go back to our rooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was on the point of Chester&#8217;s tongue to
ask in view of this conclusion why Nora had
knocked on their door, but he thought best
to refrain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisht!&#8221; whispered Mike; &#8220;let&#8217;s go to
the parlor, where we have the moonlight
to help us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Walking on tiptoe and as silent as so
many cats, the party moved through the
hall to the front room. The straining ears
heard nothing more from below stairs,
though there could be no doubt that their
visitors were still there.
</p>
<p>As Mike had intimated, the round, clear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
moon was in the sky, and looking from the
windows it seemed almost as bright as day.
The party stood just far enough back to be
invisible to anyone in the street below.
A row of elms lined each side of the highway,
being mutually separated by a dozen yards
or so. They were small, having been set out
only a few years before, but were in full
foliage and the most remote ones cast a
shadow into the highway. On the same side
of what was the main street, each frame
house that served for a dwelling had a
yard, shrubbery and flowers in front.
Farther to the left was the small grocery
store, while to the right on the same side
as the post office was the pert little village
church to which reference has already
been made.
</p>
<p>At this hour all Beartown seemed to be
sunk in slumber, as was quite proper
should be the case. From not a single window
twinkled a light nor was man, woman
or boy seen on the street. A solitary dog,
with nose down and travelling diagonally
as canines sometimes do, trotted to the front
gate of the house opposite the post office,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
jumped over and passed from view to the
rear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what that man is waiting
there for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Nora who whispered this question,
which instantly put the others on the <i>qui
vive</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any man; where is he?&#8221;
asked Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Under that tree opposite; he&#8217;s in plain
sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such was the fact now that she had
directed attention to him. The elm was
directly across the street, and had a trunk
not more than six or eight inches in diameter.
A man was standing motionless
under the dense foliage several feet above
his head, doing nothing except simply to
stand there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the lookout,&#8221; said Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a lookout?&#8221; asked the nervous
Nora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is there to watch for danger that
may threaten the others who are inside
and working at your mother&#8217;s safe. If he
sees anything wrong he will give a signal,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
probably by means of a whistle, and the
fellows below will run.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t you give the signal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could if I knew what it is, but I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! he is coming over here!&#8221; exclaimed
the affrighted Nora, as the man
stepped from the shadow, walked half way
across the street, and then halted as if in
doubt whether to advance farther.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear of his visiting us,&#8221; Alvin assured
her; &#8220;but it is best to keep out of
sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All shrank still farther back, when there
was no possibility of being seen in the first
place. The man did not look up, but kept
his slouch hat pulled so far down that
nothing of his face was visible. He held
his position for perhaps five minutes, when
he turned about and went back to his post.
There could be no doubt that he was the
lookout of the gang, as Chester had said
when he was first noticed. Not once did
he look up before reaching his place, so
that none of our friends caught a glimpse of
his features.
</p>
<p>What a unique situation! One or more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
burglars were at work on the safe below
stairs, and there were five persons on the
floor above who knew it, but did not raise
voice or a hand to interfere with them.
It has been explained why, though it should
be added that in the way of firearms there
was only the single worthless Springfield
rifle in the house. It was mother and
daughter who held the three lads supine.
Had they been left free they would have
acted immediately on first learning of the
presence of the criminals.
</p>
<p>Chester had spoken the word &#8220;dynamite,&#8221;
and it was that terrific explosive which he
and his companions dreaded unspeakably.
If the charge were fired, it would not only
blow the massive safe apart, but was likely
to wreck the building itself and probably
inflict death to more than one in the
dwelling.
</p>
<p>Mike Murphy chafed more than his
comrades. Reflecting on the exasperating
state of affairs, he determined to do something
despite the opposition of the mother
and daughter. A few minutes&#8217; thought
suggested a plan. He would have revealed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
it to Alvin and Chester, but feared they
would prevent action or that his whispering
in the darkness of the room would
awaken the suspicion of the other two.
</p>
<p>Only when near the front windows could
the members of the party dimly see one
another. They had withdrawn so far at
sight of the approach of the man on guard
that the light ill served them. Mike stealthily
retreated to the open door leading into
the hall. Neither of his comrades heard
him, and he groped along the passage, with
hands outstretched on each side to guide
him. The feet were lifted and set down
without noise, and by and by he came to
the opening leading to the bedroom. Across
this he made his way with the same noiseless
stealth, until the groping hand touched
the battered rifle, which he lifted from its
resting place. Back into the hall again,
and then through the dining room, inch by
inch, to where he remembered seeing the
head of the stairs, though he knew nothing
beyond that. He would have struck a
match but for fear of attracting the notice
of those below.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only to feel each step,&#8221; he reflected,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll soon arrive, and then won&#8217;t
fur of the spalpeens fly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His unfamiliarity with the stairs made
him think they were not so nearly perpendicular
as was the fact. While the
thought was in his mind, he made a misstep
and, unable to check himself, went
bumping all the way to the bottom.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Tall Oaks from Little Acorns Grow</span>&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>If you wish an illustration of how great
events often flow from trifling causes
read what follows. It is one of the
many events which prove that &#8220;tall oaks
from little acorns grow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>You have not forgotten Jim, the gawky,
overgrown boy who had a verbal contract
with Mrs. Friestone which bound him to
go to the store each weekday morning and
set out on the front porch the score or more
samples of the goods that were on sale
within. The same agreement required him
to come around at dusk each evening and
carry them inside, his weekly wage for such
duty being twenty-five cents. When, therefore,
Mike Murphy handed him a silver
quarter and assumed the job for that single
night, Jim received a whole week&#8217;s pay for
turning it over to the Irish lad. It is not
so strange that the youngster was confused
at first over his bit of luck, which he did
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
not fully understand until he reached home
and had eaten his supper.
</p>
<p>Now by one of those curious coincidences
which occur oftener in this life than most
people think, that day was the anniversary
of Jim&#8217;s birth. Being a good boy, as such
things go, his father presented him with a
fine pocketknife, than which nothing could
have pleased his son better. It was really
an excellent article, having four blades, one
of which was a file, two of small size, and
one quite large, the three being almost as
keen-edged as a razor. Straightway the
happy lad selected his right hand trousers
pocket as the home of the knife when not
in use. The miscellaneous articles, such as
a jewsharp, a piece of twine, a key, three
coppers, a piece of resin, several marbles,
two ten-penny nails, a stub of a lead pencil
and a few other things were shifted to the
left side repository, where also he deposited
the shining silver coin, after showing it to his
parents and telling them how he fell heir to
it.
</p>
<p>The chat of the family shut out reference
to the knife for most of the evening. Both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
parents were inclined to be gossipy, and
they indulged in many guesses as to the
identity of the donor and what caused him
to be so liberal. The mother&#8217;s first thought
was that the red-haired, freckle-faced youth
was a newcomer to Beartown, and had
secured Jim&#8217;s job, but that fear was removed
by Jim&#8217;s declaration that the stranger
distinctly said he intended to do the work
only for that evening.
</p>
<p>It was not very late when Jim went to
his bedroom on the second floor to retire for
the night. When ready to disrobe, he took
out the wealth of treasures in his left pocket,
including the bright quarter, and shoved
his hand into the other for the prize that
outweighed them all. Then he emitted
a gasp of dismay: the pocket was empty!
</p>
<p>For a few moments he could not believe
the truth. He frantically searched his
clothing over and over again, but in vain.
The explanation was as clear as noonday.
In the bottom of his right-hand pocket was
a gaping rent, through which he pushed
two fingers and disgustedly spread them
apart like a fan. He turned the cloth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
wrong side out and the dreadful yawn
seemed to grin at him.
</p>
<p>Weak and faint he sat down on the edge
of his trundle bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What made that blamed hole? It
wasn&#8217;t there a little while ago. It must
have wored the hole while I was walking.
I wouldn&#8217;t lose that knife for ten million
dollars. It <i>can&#8217;t</i> be lost!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then he repeated the search, as almost
anyone will do in similar circumstances.
He even looked under the jewsharp
and among the marbles on the stand,
where a mosquito could not have hidden
itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the use!&#8221; he exclaimed, dropping
down again despairingly on the bed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s lost! Where did I lose it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pulling himself together, he recalled the
experiences of the day, from the time he
received the present directly after breakfast.
He had tested the implement many
times in the course of the forenoon and afternoon,
and by and by remembered snapping
the big blade shut and slipping it into his
pocket as he was going out of the house to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
the post office to perform his daily task.
He reasoned well.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost it somewhere atween here and
the store. I can&#8217;t see how it slipped down
my trousers leg without me feeling it, but
that&#8217;s what it done. It&#8217;s a-laying on the
ground atween here and there, onless,&#8221;
he added, with a catch of his breath, &#8220;that
ugly looking willain seen me drop it inside
the store. I wonder if he give me that
quarter so as to hurry me out that he might
git my knife!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shivered at the probability, but rather
singularly the dread was dissipated by a
few minutes more of thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;d seen it, so would Nora and she&#8217;d
told me. It&#8217;s somewhere along the street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Such being his conclusion, the all-important
question was what should he do to
retrieve his crushing loss. His first inclination
was to tell his parents and then hurry
back over the route to look for the treasure.
But it was night. There was no such thing
as a lantern in the house, he could not
carry an ordinary light in the breeze, and
the search would be hopeless.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get up as soon as it is light,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and hunt till I find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Trying to gain hope from this decision,
he knelt at the side of his bed to say his
prayers, which he never omitted. His
petition was longer than usual and I need
not tell you what its chief if not its whole
burden was.
</p>
<p>Despite the depressing weight upon his
spirits, Jim fell asleep and remained so for
several hours, though his slumber was tortured
by dreams of his knife. Sometimes it
was tiny as a pin and then bigger than
himself, but it always slipped from his
grasp when he reached out to seize it.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he awoke. It took a minute
or two to recall his situation, but soon the
startling truth came back to him. He had
lost his knife, and, remembering his resolve
before going to sleep, he bounded out of
bed, certain that day not only had dawned
but that it had been light for some time.
He soon discovered, however, that what he
took for the glow of the rising sun came
from the moon, whose vivid illumination
made the mistake natural.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never seen it so bright,&#8221; he said,
stepping to the window and peering out.
</p>
<p>And then as if by inspiration he whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the right time to hunt for my knife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did not know what time it was nor
did he care to know. There was so much
moongleam in his room that he easily
dressed without any artificial light. Then,
too, the night was mild and his covering
scanty. Shirt and trousers were his only
garments. He left his straw hat where he
had &#8220;hung&#8221; it on the floor in one corner
beside his shoes and stockings. The chief
cause for now going barefoot was that his
steps would be lighter, though as a rule he
saved his shoes for Sunday and his trips to
and from the store.
</p>
<p>He knew his father was a light sleeper,
and if awakened would probably forbid
him to go out before morning. So Jim
opened his bedroom door so softly that not
the slightest noise was caused. He went
down the stairs as if he were a real burglar
in rubber shoes. He stopped several times
with a faster beating heart, for although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
he had never known the steps to squeak
before they now did so with such loudness
that he was sure his father heard him. But
the snoring continued unbroken and Jim
reached the door, where he stealthily slid
back the bolt and reversed the key, without
causing any betraying sound.
</p>
<p>This side of the house was in shadow, and
he stood for a minute or two on the small,
covered porch looking out upon the highway
or main street. Not a soul was in sight,
nor did he see a twinkle of light from any
of the windows. It cannot be said that
Jim felt any fear, nor did he reflect upon the
risk caused by leaving the door unlocked
behind him. He was thinking only of that
loved knife.
</p>
<p>He had walked to and from the store so
many times that he knew every step taken
earlier in the evening. It was impossible
to go wrong, and he was quite confident of
finding the knife unless the brilliant moonlight
had disclosed it to some late passerby.
</p>
<p>Jim always crossed the street at a certain
point, the post office being on the other
side, so he trod in his own footsteps, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
would have worn a path long before but
for those of others, including horses and
wagons. He walked slowly, scanning every
inch of the ground and clay pavement in
front of him, but when he drew near the
well-remembered building he had not caught
sight of the prize. He was within a few
paces of the steps of the porch of the store,
when he was suddenly startled by a gruff
voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there! Where you going?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned his head as a man stepped
from under the small elm behind him. Both
being on the same level the slouch hat only
partially hid the grim face and big mustache.
Jim would have been more scared
had he not caught sight an instant before
of his knife lying at the foot of the steps of
the porch. He sprang forward, caught it
up and then faced the stranger, who had
stepped into the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking fur my knife that I dropped
and I&#8217;ve found it too!&#8221; he replied gleefully,
holding up the cool, shiny implement.
&#8220;Gee! aint I lucky?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you get out of here as quick as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
you can. Go back home and stay there
till morning. Do ye hear me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws; I&#8217;m going.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A strange discovery had come to Jim
the instant before. As he stooped to
seize his property, his eyes were at the
same height as the bottom of the door
leading into the store. It was only for a
second or two, but in that brief space he
saw a faint glimmer through the crevice,
which he knew was caused by a light
within. With a shrewdness that no one
would have expected from him he said
nothing of his discovery to the man who had
accosted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind what I told you!&#8221; added the stranger,
&#8220;and don&#8217;t show your nose outside
your house before morning. Understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws; I don&#8217;t want to, &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve
got my knife. Hooray!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up! Off with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws;&#8221; and Jim broke into a trot
which he kept up until he reached his own
porch. In his exuberance of spirits, he was
careless and awoke his father. He came
into the hall and roared out a demand for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
an explanation, which his son gave in a
few hurried words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooh!&#8221; exclaimed his parent; &#8220;there&#8217;s
robbers in the post office and I think I&#8217;ll
take a hand as soon as I can get hold of my
shotgun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Which may serve to explain how it was
that Gerald Buxton became involved in
the incidents that speedily followed.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Clever Trick</span></h3>
</div>

<p>At the foot of the rear stairs in the
home of Widow Friestone was an
ordinary door latched at night,
but without any lock. When Mike Murphy
was groping about in the blank darkness,
where nothing was familiar, he did not
know, as has been said, of the steepness
of the steps. Thus he placed his shoe upon
vacancy, and, unable to check himself,
bumped to the bottom, striking every step
on the route, and banging against the door
with such force that the latch gave away,
it flew open, and he sprawled on his hands
and knees, still grasping the rifle with
which he had set out to hunt for burglars.
He was not hurt, and bounded like a rubber
ball to his feet.
</p>
<p>An amazing scene confronted him. A
young man, his face covered with a mask,
had just drawn back the ponderous door
of the safe, and by the light of a small dark
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
lantern in his left hand was trying to unlock
one of the inner compartments, with a
bunch of small keys held in his right.
It was at this instant that the racket
followed by the crash which burst open the
door paralyzed him for the moment. He
straightened up and stared through the
holes of his mask at the apparition that
had descended upon him like a thunderbolt,
in helpless amazement.
</p>
<p>If he was terrified, Mike Murphy was
not. Forgetful of his shillaleh in the shape
of the Springfield, he made a leap at the
fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;S&#8217;render, ye spalpeen!&#8221; he shouted.
The criminal answered by viciously hurling
the lantern into the face of his assailant,
and in the act, the mask somehow or other
was disarranged and slipped from its place.
It was only a passing glimpse that Mike
caught of him, but it identified him as one of
the young men who had attacked Alvin
Landon some nights before while passing
through the stretch of woods near his home.
</p>
<p>The throwing of the lamp was the best
thing the burglar could have done, for it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
caught the Irish youth fairly between the
eyes and dazed him for an invaluable
second or two. Instant to seize his advantage,
the criminal made a leap through the
rear window, which he had left open for that
purpose, and sped like a deer across the
back yard of the premises. Mike was
at his heels and shouted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! stop! or I&#8217;ll blow ye into smithereens!
I&#8217;ve got a double barreled cannon wid
me, and if ye want to save yer life, s&#8217;render
before I touch her off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Perhaps if the fugitive had not been in
so wild a panic he would have given himself
up, for no man willingly invites the discharge
of a deadly weapon a few paces
behind him. But the youth was bent on
escape if the feat were possible and ran
with the vigor of desperation.
</p>
<p>Less than a hundred yards over the
garden beds and grass took the fellow to the
paling boundary over which he leaped like
a greyhound. Mike would have done the
same, but feared it was too much for him.
Moreover, his short legs could not carry
him as fast as those of the fleeing one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
The pursuer rested a hand on the palings
and went over without trouble. By that
time the fugitive was a goodly distance off
in the act of clearing a second fence. In
dread lest he should get away, Mike called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have sinse, ye lunkhead! I don&#8217;t want
to kill ye, but hanged if I don&#8217;t, if ye fail to
lay down yer arms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The appeal like all that had preceded it
was unheeded. The burglar must have
taken heart from the fact that his pursuer
had already held his fire so long. Running
with unusual speed, he took advantage of
the shadow offered by several back buildings
and continued steadily to gain. When he
made a quick turn and whisked out of
sight, the exasperated Mike dropped to a
rapid walk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, if this owld gun was only
in shape! there wouldn&#8217;t be any sich race
as this, as Brian O&#8217;Donovan said&mdash;phwat&#8217;s
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>When within twenty feet of a small barn,
a burly man stepped out of the gloom and
with a large gun levelled gruffly commanded:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Throw up your arms or I&#8217;ll let moonlight
through you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any room for argyment, as
Jed Mitchell said whin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with your hands! and drop that
gun!&#8221; thundered the other, and Mike let
the old rifle fall to his feet and reached up
as if trying to hold the moon in place.
Which incident requires an explanation.
</p>
<p>Gerald Buxton, the father of Jim, had no
sooner heard the story of his boy than he
decided, as had been related, that something
was wrong at the post office. He had read
of the many robberies in southern Maine
during the preceding summer, else he might
not have been so quick to reach a conclusion.
He woke his wife, told her his belief and then
took down his shotgun from over the deer&#8217;s
antlers in the kitchen. Both barrels were
always loaded, but to make sure of no lack
of ammunition, he put a number of extra
shells loaded with heavy shot into his
pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said impressively to his
son, &#8220;to stay home and not show your
nose outside the door while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yaws, sir,&#8221; meekly replied Jim, who
three minutes later, unseen by his mother,
sneaked out of the back door and reached
the battlefield directly behind his parent.
</p>
<p>Mr. Buxton had never had any experience
with house breakers, and did some
quick thinking from the moment he left
his front gate until he arrived on the scene.
Nothing seemed more natural than that the
ruffians would not approach the house
from the front, but by the rear. The light
which Jim saw must have come from
the back part of the store. For the gang
to make their entrance from the main street
would have been far more dangerous.
</p>
<p>Because of this theory, Mr. Buxton
crossed the road directly before his own
house, passed through the alley of a neighbor,
and followed a circuitous course which
compelled him to climb several back fences.
But he knew all the people, and in case he
was questioned could readily explain matters.
</p>
<p>So in due time he came to the barn of
one of his friends, and had turned to pass
around it when to his astonishment a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
man dashed toward him on a dead run.
Buxton was alert, and pointing his weapon,
crisply commanded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop or I&#8217;ll fire!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The panting fellow obeyed with the
exclamation:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad of what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you came as you did. There
are burglars in the post office!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought, but wasn&#8217;t
sure. Who are you and why are you in
such an all-fired hurry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of them is chasing me. I tried to
wake the postmistress, when he heard me
and I had to run for my life. How thankful
I am that you appeared just in time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the scandalous villain?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Buxton, glancing on all sides.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be here in a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t wait for him; tell me where he
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fugitive, who was momentarily expecting
the appearance of his pursuer,
pointed to the barn around which he had
just dashed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming from there. Look out, or
he&#8217;ll shoot you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for him,&#8221; exclaimed the
angered citizen as he hurriedly trotted off
and confronted Mike Murphy a few seconds
later.
</p>
<p>We have learned of the pointed conversation
which passed between them. Mike&#8217;s
first thought was that it was one of the
robbers who had held him up, but there
was no gainsaying the argument brought
to bear against him. He remained with
hands uplifted, awaiting the will of his
captor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re one of those post office
robbers,&#8221; said Mr. Buxton, partly lowering
his weapon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; replied Mike,
beginning to scent the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a pistol?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only deadly wippon I have is me
pocketknife, with its two blades broke
and the handle being lost some time since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the rest of your gang?&#8221;
demanded the man, stepping closer to the
youth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The two frinds that I have are wid the
widder Mrs. Friestone, doing their best to
entertain the leddy and her daughter, while
I started out to chase one of the spalpeens
that run too fast for me to catch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Buxton stepped still nearer. He was
becoming doubtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the mischief are you, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike Murphy, born in Tipperary, in
the County of Tipperary, Ireland, and lately,
arrove in Ameriky.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Standing still for the time, as Pat Mulrooney
said whin the byes tied him to the
gate post and wint off and left him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you one of those post office robbers?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question told Mike the whole truth.
It was a clever trick that had been played
upon him, and his musical laugh rang out
on the still night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What made ye have that opinion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I just met a young chap the other side
of this barn, and when I stopped him he
said he was running away from an enemy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which the same was the thruth.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that one of the gang was chasing
him, meaning to shoot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mesilf that would have shot if I&#8217;d
had a gun wid a conscience, fur I catched
the spalpeen when he was opening the safe
of Widder Friestone, and I made after him;
but most persons can run faster than mesilf,
owing to me short legs, and he was laving me
behind, whin ye interfared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that first fellow
was one of the burglars?&#8221; asked the
astounded Mr. Buxton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As sure as ye are standing there admiring
me looks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound the rapscallion! I&#8217;ll get him
yet!&#8221; and the irate citizen dashed off with
the resolution, to put it mildly, of correcting
the error he had made.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>In the Nick of Time</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Standing in the darkness of the
upper front room, stealthily watching
the mysterious stranger on the other
side of the street in the shadow of the elm,
and knowing that burglars were at work
below stairs&mdash;the nerves of mother and
daughter and of Alvin Landon and Chester
Haynes were on edge. Had they peered out
of the window less than half an hour earlier
they would have seen the meeting between
the lookout and young Jim Buxton.
</p>
<p>Mike Murphy had slipped so silently
from among them that no one was aware
of his absence when the bumping and crash
at the rear were followed by exclamations
and words that were not intelligible. Mrs.
Friestone uttered a faint cry and sank
back on her chair. Nora screamed and
threw her arms about her mother&#8217;s neck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will kill us! What shall we do?&#8221;
she wailed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>For the moment Alvin and Chester,
startled almost as much as their friends,
were mystified. When Chester said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like Mike&#8217;s voice. Hello,
Mike, are you here with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The failure to receive a reply proved that
Chester was right. Their comrade had
stolen off and was already in a &#8220;shindy&#8221; at
the rear of the store.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He may need our help!&#8221; called Alvin,
starting for the stairs, with his chum at
his heels. But Nora, who had heard the
unguarded words, called in wild distress:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave us! Don&#8217;t leave us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They stopped irresolute. They could not
abandon the two, and yet Mike&#8217;s life might
be in peril.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to them,&#8221; whispered Chester.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no call for both of us to stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not go down yourself; you know
you have no weapon. Let&#8217;s take a look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>First of all it was necessary to quiet the
daughter and mother, for one was as much
terrified as the other. Alvin hastened into
the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not leave you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
we wish to see what we can from the kitchen
window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you may fall out,&#8221; moaned Nora,
scarcely responsible for what she said.
Even in the crisis of a tragedy a vein of
comedy will sometimes intrude itself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have no fear of that,&#8221; replied Alvin.
&#8220;I will hold Chester from tumbling out
and he will do the same for me. Pray,
compose yourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During this brief absence Chester had
threaded his way past the furniture in the
darkness to the window, out of which he was
gazing on a most interesting moving picture
which had vanished when Alvin appeared
at his elbow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It made my blood tingle,&#8221; said Chester.
&#8220;I was just in time to see a man, who must
have leaped out, running for life with Mike
in pursuit. He had that old gun in one
hand&mdash;as if it could prove of any earthly
use to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow, after leaping the fence,
turned to the right and disappeared among
the shadows.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With Mike still chasing him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As hard as he could run, but you know
he hasn&#8217;t much speed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; whispered Alvin, &#8220;whether
there are any more of them downstairs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They stepped noiselessly to the head of
the steps and listened. Everything was
so quiet that they heard the ticking of the
clock on the wall of the store.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anyone is there. Let&#8217;s
take a closer look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin struck a match from his safe and
led the way, thus saving the two from the
mishap that had overtaken their friend.
They were a trifle nervous when they
stepped upon the lower floor, Alvin maintaining
the illumination by burning more
matches. He climbed upon the counter,
and lighted the large oil lamp suspended
there for such purpose. Adjusting the
wick to the highest point it would stand
without smoking, the two looked around.
</p>
<p>What they saw completed the story that
had already taken shape in their own minds.
The unbroken dark lantern lay on the floor
where it had fallen, the light having been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
extinguished. The raised window showed
by what avenue the burglar and Mike had
left the building, but what amazed the
youths more than anything else was the
wide open door of the safe. Not a burglar&#8217;s
tool or device was in sight, and the appearance
of the lock and door without a scratch
showing proved that no part of the structure
had been tampered with. It was just as
if Mrs. Friestone had manipulated it&mdash;as
she had done times without number.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever opened it must have known
the combination. And how did he learn it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Mrs. Friestone can guess. I&#8217;ll
ask her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Going to the foot of the stairs, the young
man called to the woman just loudly enough
for her to hear. He said the visitors had
left, but the door of the safe was open and
it was advisable for her to come down and
take a look at things.
</p>
<p>She timidly came down the steps, with
Nora tremblingly clinging to her skirts,
ready to scream and dash back to the front
of the house on the first appearance of danger.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
But nothing occurred to cause new
alarm, and mother and daughter stared
wonderingly at the safe with its wide open
door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did that?&#8221; asked the woman, in a
faint voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the burglars,&#8221; replied Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he learn the combination?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the mystery; Alvin and I
cannot guess. Was it known to anyone
besides yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I changed it two days ago and did
not even tell Nora. Not another soul
knew it&mdash;and look!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pointed to a bunch of keys, one of
which was inserted in the lock of the
middle small drawer, with a half dozen
others dangling from the metal ring. It
will be understood that while the door of
the safe was opened by means of a usual
combination of numbers, the interior was
guarded by only a tiny lock and key. This
was more convenient, for, when the massive
door was drawn back, the little wooden
drawers, even with a combination, would
not avail long against a burglar.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They have taken the money!&#8221; gasped
the widow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Alvin spoke, he turned the key. The
lock clicked and he drew out the drawer.
There lay the big sealed envelope with the
two thousand five hundred dollars intact
within, while the stamps and cash receipts
of the day were neatly piled on the shelf
beneath.
</p>
<p>The astonishing truth was that the criminal
had been interrupted at the critical
moment when he had succeeded in fitting a
key to the lock. Had Mike Murphy been
the fraction of a minute later in bursting
upon the scene, he would have been too
late. The robber would have carried off
nearly three thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I call the greatest luck
that ever happened,&#8221; said Chester.
</p>
<p>The discovery was as cheering as amazing.
The large amount of money had been
saved by a hair&#8217;s breadth. The woman
clasped her hands in thankfulness. Chester
slowly shoved the steel door shut.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now try the combination,&#8221; he said to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Mrs. Friestone. &#8220;Chester and I will turn
our backs while you do so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why will you do that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that we shall not learn the secret.
If anything like this happens again, you
cannot say we did it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw the smile on his face and knew
he spoke in jest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be the lock was broken in some
way,&#8221; suggested Chester.
</p>
<p>But it worked perfectly. The knob was
turned forward till the finger pointed to a
number, then back and then forward again
to another numeral. It moved as smoothly
as if the delicate mechanism was oiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now open it,&#8221; she said to the lads, her
spirits rallying over her good fortune.
They shook their heads and Chester said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might succeed, and that would be
suspicious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you noticed the combination
or not, you surely did not know what it
was a little while ago. I acquit you of
having any understanding with the burglars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of Mike?&#8221; asked Nora
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
plaintively, speaking for the first time.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid something dreadful has happened
to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is probably still chasing the bad
man,&#8221; said Chester.
</p>
<p>As if in answer to her wail a hasty tread
was heard at that moment and a bushy red
head without a cap appeared at the window,
as if flung thither by the hand of a giant.
The bright light within the door told him
the story.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The top of the morning to ye all, for
I jedge it&#8217;s near morning, as Tim Mulligan
said after he had been slaaping fur two days
and nights. I hope ye are all well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He began climbing through and was half
inside when Nora dashed forward and
caught hold of his arm. It so disarranged
his balance that he tumbled on the floor,
the rifle falling from his grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you, Mike! I was
afraid those awful people had killed you,&#8221;
said the happy girl. &#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not worth speaking of; I think my
neck is broke and me lift leg fractured in
two places, but niver mind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Then the exuberant youth told his
story, to which his friends listened with
breathless interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t catch the villain?&#8221;
said Chester inquiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I made it hot fur him, as me
cousin said after chasing the expriss train
a couple of miles. He has longer legs than
mesilf. The next time I engage in a chase
wid him I&#8217;ll make sure his legs is sawed
off at the knees, so as to give me a chance.
If I had thought to have that done I&#8217;d
brought the spalpeen back to ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you drove him off in the nick
of time. He didn&#8217;t get away with a penny,&#8221;
said Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what was the maans he used to
open that door? That&#8217;s what gits me&mdash;whisht!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The report of a gun rang out on the stillness,
and the friends stared at one another.
Before anyone could venture an explanation,
the sound of hurried footsteps told
that someone was approaching.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>I Piped and Ye Danced</span>&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Gerald Buxton was boiling over
with indignation when he parted
company with Mike Murphy and
realized how he had been tricked. He had
allowed the real burglar to get away while he
held up his innocent pursuer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask is one sight of that villain!&#8221;
he muttered, striking into a lope which
carried him rapidly over the ground. Since
the fugitive had disappeared several minutes
before and there was no telling what
course he had taken, it would seem there
was not one chance in a hundred of Buxton
ever seeing him again.
</p>
<p>But, although the citizen had been cleverly
hoodwinked, he used shrewdness in wrestling
with the problem. As he viewed it, the
fellow was likely to make for the stretch of
woods between Beartown and the river, that
he might screen himself as quickly as possible.
He would lose no time in getting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
away from the village as soon as he could.
It was quite probable that he and his gang
had come up or down the river and had a
launch awaiting them. To avoid going
astray, he would use the highway which
joined Beartown and the landing.
</p>
<p>Mr. Buxton had to climb three fences
before he reached an open field of slight
extent, beyond which lay the woods. He
knew the chances of overtaking the criminal
were meagre, but with a thrill of delight
he caught sight of his man only a little way
in front and walking in the same direction
with himself. He seemed to have sprung
from the ground, and it was clear that he
had no thought of further pursuit. His
follower tried to get nearer to him before
he reached the woods, but the fellow heard
him and glancing over his shoulder broke
into a run.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop or I&#8217;ll fire!&#8221; shouted Buxton.
</p>
<p>After the young man&#8217;s experience with
his first pursuer and his Springfield, he could
not be blamed for refusing to heed the command.
He ran the faster and the next
minute would have whisked beyond reach,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
had not Buxton come to an abrupt halt,
and taking a quick aim, fired.
</p>
<p>He got his man too. With a cry of pain
he leaped several feet in the air and fell.
Terrified by what he had done, Buxton
ran forward, gun in hand, and called out
while several paces distant:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt bad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m done for,&#8221; was the reply as the
wounded fellow laboriously climbed to his
feet.
</p>
<p>With anger turned into sympathy, the
captor asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did I hit you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You shattered my right leg,&#8221; was the
reply, accompanied by groans as the fellow
with excruciating effort tried to support
himself on the other limb.
</p>
<p>Buxton laid down his weapon and knelt
to examine the wound. He saw now that
the lower part of the trousers leg was
shredded by the charge of shot and that,
doubtless, the hurt was a very grievous
one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I gave it to you so bad, but
you can&#8217;t deny you desarved it. If you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
able to walk back to my house, with my
help, I&#8217;ll get a doctor and we&#8217;ll soon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that instant the young man sprang
back a couple of paces, and the startled
Buxton looking up saw that he stood
firmly on both feet, with the shotgun
pointed at him. He had snatched up the
weapon while the owner was stooping over to
inspect the wound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s <i>my</i> turn!&#8221; he said, with a
chuckle. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t your fault that you
didn&#8217;t kill me, and it will be my fault if I
don&#8217;t even matters up with you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poor Buxton slowly came to the upright
position, with jaws dropping and eyes
staring. He could only mumble:
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-w-what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing with me; it&#8217;s <i>you</i> that&#8217;s in a
hole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Believing it was all up with him, the
terrified victim stood mute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to shoot you down and I&#8217;ll
do so if you don&#8217;t obey me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-w-what do you want?&#8221; Buxton managed
to stammer out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dance!&#8221; was the crisp command.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>The citizen stared, not comprehending
the order.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We cowboys in the West when we want
a little fun make a tenderfoot dance while
we fire our revolvers at his feet. BEGIN!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The victim lowered the point of the gun
so as to point it at the shoes of Mr. Buxton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t dance; never done it in my
life,&#8221; he stuttered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t begin earlier. Start up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Knowing what was ordered, the victim
obeyed. He leaped up and down, shuffled
his feet and made such comical antics that
the gun wabbled in the hands of the laughing
master of the situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have one loaded barrel left and I&#8217;m
aching to let you have it! Keep it up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now that he had started, Mr. Buxton
threw more vigor into his steps. He
bounded in the air, side-stepped, kicked
out his feet, tried a number of fancy movements
of which he knew nothing, and
acted like an energetic youth taking his
first lessons in that branch of the terpsichorean
art called buck dancing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn your back toward me and dance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
all the way home! If you let up for one
minute or look around I&#8217;ll blaze away, and
you won&#8217;t get the charge in your <i>feet</i>!
Remember that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Buxton reflected that having left
home so jauntily with loaded weapon over
his shoulder, it would be anything but a
dignified return to dance back again without
it. If he jig-stepped down the main
street some neighbor was likely to see him
and make remarks. A waltz through the
gate, up the steps of the porch and into
the hall, by which time it would probably
be safe for him to cease his exhausting performance,
would undoubtedly cause annoying
inquiries on the part of his wife and
family.
</p>
<p>But there was hope. He might gain a
start that would make it safe to resume his
natural gait. He did his best. Facing
the boundary fence less than two hundred
yards away he kicked up his heels, swung
his arms in unison, and steadily drew away
from that fearful form standing with gun
levelled at him. He yearned to break into
a run, but dared not. He believed his tormentor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
was following so as to keep him in
range.
</p>
<p>It was hardly to be expected that he
should go over the fence with a dance step,
but he reflected that he could resume his
labors immediately he dropped to the
ground on the other side and faithfully
maintain it to the next boundary. But
there was risk and he was afraid to incur
it. While still shifting his feet with an
energy that caused him to breathe fast, he
approached the obstruction. Partly turning
his head while toiling as hard as ever,
he called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to stop a minute till I climb
over, but I&#8217;ll resoom dancing as soon as I
hit the ground on the other side agin. Is
that all right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no reply and he repeated
the question in a louder voice. Still hearing
nothing, he ventured to look back. The
young man was nowhere in sight. Truth to
tell, no sooner had Mr. Buxton begun his
humorous exhibition than the youth, vainly
trying to suppress his mirth, flung down the
gun, turned about and entered the wood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
toward which he was running when so
abruptly checked by his pursuer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;ll be hanged!&#8221; was the disgusted
exclamation of the panting Buxton.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the meanest trick I ever had played
on me. The scand&#8217;lous villain oughter be
hung. What a sight I made! I&#8217;m mighty
glad no one seen me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In his relief, he did not notice a vague
form which flitted along the edge of the
wood, so close to the trees that the shadow
screened it from clear view. Had Mr.
Buxton noted it he might not have felt
certain that no one witnessed his unrivalled
performance.
</p>
<p>He was so tired out from his tremendous
efforts that he stood awhile mopping his
moist forehead with his handkerchief while
he regained his wind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lucky he didn&#8217;t foller and make me
dance all the way home. Never could have
done it. Would have dropped dead, I am
that blamed tired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He leaned against the fence while recovering
from his unwonted exercise. Naturally
he believed the young man who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
used him so ill had carried away his weapon
beyond possibility of recovery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I paid twenty-five dollars for it
in Portland,&#8221; he bitterly mused. &#8220;It
looks to me that as a hunter of post office
robbers I ain&#8217;t of much account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He resumed his walk homeward, going
slowly, carefully climbing the obstructions
in his path and studying what explanation
to make to his friends for the loss of his
valuable piece. He might manage it with
all except his wife and son. It would not
do to tell them he had dropped it somewhere
along the road without noticing the accident.
A boy might lose his pocketknife
(I know of a youngster who lost a wheelbarrow
and never found it again), but a
double barreled shotgun manifestly could
not disappear in that fashion so much out
of the ordinary way of things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have a look at the post office
and larn what mischief the villain done
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He veered in his course and came to the
back window, where a light showed that
some persons were gathered. He found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
mother, daughter and the three boys, who
gave him warm greeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that your gun we heard a little
while ago?&#8221; asked the woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it must have been,&#8221; replied
Mr. Buxton, who declined the invitation to
enter and remained standing outside the
window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hit the burglar?&#8221; asked Alvin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; said Mr. Buxton loftily,
&#8220;when I fire at anything I <i>always</i> hit it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t kill him, Gerald!&#8221; exclaimed
the horrified mother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I just winged him so he won&#8217;t
forget it if he lives a thousand years; don&#8217;t
like to kill a scamp even if he is a burglar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your gun?&#8221; continued Alvin.
</p>
<p>The man glanced around as if it were
hidden somewhere about his garments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now isn&#8217;t that a fine go?&#8221; he exclaimed
disgustedly. &#8220;I set it down while I went
forward to see how bad that feller was hit,
and plumb forgot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;O dad, here&#8217;s your gun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the son Jim who called this greeting
as he straddled forward with the heavy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
piece resting on his shoulder. All stared in
amazement, and the father in his confusion
was imprudent enough to ask:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen that feller that took it away
from you and made you dance all the way
across the field. He throwed it down and
went into the woods. When I seen you
hopping and dancing and kicking up your
heels I nearly died a-larfing. But I didn&#8217;t
forgit the gun, and run along the edge of the
woods and picked it up. Gee! it&#8217;s heavy!
But, dad, I didn&#8217;t know you could dance
like that. Say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You young rascal, didn&#8217;t I tell you to
stay home? I&#8217;ll larn you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The parent made a dive at his son, who,
with the gun still over his shoulder, scooted
across the yard and over the fence, with his
irate father in fierce pursuit.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>How It Was Done</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The attempt to rob the safe in the
Beartown post office was accompanied
by more than one unique
incident. Chief among these was the cowardice
exhibited by two of the three
members who composed the little band of
lawbreakers.
</p>
<p>It has been shown that the full-grown
man with a big mustache acted as a lookout
at the front, which is perhaps the safest
post for a criminal in such circumstances,
since he has a good chance to get away on
the first approach of danger. A second
lookout was placed at the rear. After-developments
showed that the trio was
headed by Kit Woodford, the adult member,
who had led a life of crime since boyhood
and had served a term in prison. He would
have been more successful as a criminal
except for his rank cowardice which caused
him to be despised and cast out by several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
gangs with which he sought to connect
himself.
</p>
<p>The other two burglars were Orestes
Noxon and Graff Miller, neither of whom
had reached his majority by more than two
years. It was Miller who took his station
at the rear, where on the first sign of something
amiss he sneaked off without giving
the signal which would have warned Noxon
in time to flee unharmed. In his way, he
was as lacking in personal courage as Kit
Woodford. The latter held his place until
the racket caused by Mike Murphy&#8217;s tumble
downstairs apprised him that things were
not going right. He ventured upon a single
timid whistle, which no one else heard, and
then slunk down the road, hugging the
shadows and intent only on saving his
own bacon.
</p>
<p>How was it that young Noxon was
assigned the most perilous task of all, when
in reality he was the youngest of the three?
It was due to a peculiar skill which neither
of the others possessed. He proved more
than once that he could take position in
front of an ordinary safe&mdash;not the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
modern kind&mdash;and by a wonderfully deft
manipulation of the knob which governed
the combination tell by the fall of the tumblers
just when the index struck the right
numerals. He demonstrated this power
many times when all others who made the
trial failed. He asked simply to be left
undisturbed with his ear against the steel
door as he turned the knob with infinite
delicacy. He was proud of his ability
in this respect, and when Kit Woodford
gave him the post of peril he accepted it
as a compliment and eagerly essayed the
task.
</p>
<p>Although there is no evidence on the
point, it is quite sure that Kit Woodford,
whose chief business was to spy out the
land, knew that several wealthy citizens of
Beartown made a practice of leaving large
deposits with Mrs. Friestone overnight
or for several nights and days. It is not
to be supposed that Woodford would rob
so insignificant a post office for the small
booty that belonged to the government.
Quite likely he was aware of the large sum
left with her on the afternoon before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>But Mike Murphy&#8217;s original style of
descending the back stairs brought the
schemes of the criminals to naught, and
saved the safe from spoliation. I have told
how the three criminals scattered to as many
different points of the compass. They could
not have come together again had not
previous provision been made for such emergencies.
The leader, having shaken himself
clear of the village, turned into the wood
and picked his way toward the river. He
was to the north, however, while the other
lookout, Miller, was to the south, and
neither knew how far apart they were.
</p>
<p>There seemed little risk in signalling, and
after Woodford had gone half way to the
river he paused among the shadows and
listened. He had been startled by the report
of the gun, but everything was now still.
Placing his thumb and forefinger between
his lips, he emitted a sharp, tremulous
whistle, which was instantly answered by a
similar call from some point not far off.
A few minutes later he and Miller, after a
few precautions, came together among the
shadows.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you would be somewhere in the
neighborhood,&#8221; was the young man&#8217;s explanation,
&#8220;and I was listening for your signal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; growled the elder, &#8220;Noxon made
a mess of it to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what happened? Did
you see anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him dash out from the rear of
that store with someone chasing him with
a loaded gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That must have been what we heard a
little while ago. Looks as if they got Nox.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; remarked the
other indifferently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He oughter managed things better.
How was it you didn&#8217;t warn him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did; I whistled twice the instant I
saw his danger, and ran the risk of getting it
in the neck myself,&#8221; was the unblushing
response of the youth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s anything we
can do for him. He got himself in a hole
through his own foolishness and must pull
himself out. My motto when a gang gets
into trouble is that every one must look out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
for himself and the devil take the hindmost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Kit,&#8221; said Miller, lowering his
voice as if fearful of being overheard, &#8220;do
you think they&#8217;ll get Nox?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t a doubt of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, do you think there&#8217;s any danger
of his squealing, that is, if he hasn&#8217;t been
killed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw,&#8221; was the disgusted reply. &#8220;Nox
is game&mdash;true blue; you can bet on him
till the cows come home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Which was more than Nox could say
about his two pals.
</p>
<p>Kit Woodford may have spoken with
confidence, but he was not as free from
misgivings as he would have it appear. He
could not feel sure of their missing companion.
If the report which they had
heard did not mean that he had been slain,
his capture looked certain, and there was
no saying what he might do to secure
leniency. Kit knew what <i>he</i> would do in
a similar situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come on,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;We&#8217;re
in tough luck to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>And the two pushed their way among the
trees in the direction of the river.
</p>
<p>Meantime, matters remained interesting
at the home of Widow Friestone. The words
of young Jim Buxton told a graphic story
which made even Nora laugh and forget
for the time the frightful excitement they
had passed through. When the merriment
had partly subsided, Mike drew one
of his remaining two quarters from his
pocket and handed it to Nora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will ye do me the kindness to presint
that to Jim when he comes to the store in
the morning to set the table on the front
porch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that for?&#8221; asked the puzzled
girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the gayety he imparted to this
gloomy avening. I don&#8217;t know as ye need
say that to him, for he wouldn&#8217;t understand
what ye meant until after three or four
years of hard thought. But he&#8217;s airned it,
and ye&#8217;ll not forgit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laid the coin aside and assured the
donor that his wishes should be carried
out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Chester spoke:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me we are throwing away
time. It is past midnight and here we sit
talking, and doing nothing because there
seems nothing to do. What do you think,
Alvin?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right. This business doesn&#8217;t
seem to have stirred up the town. I don&#8217;t
suppose anyone knows what has happened
except Mr. Buxton and his family, and I
don&#8217;t think he will tell the particulars
himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That can be lift to Jim,&#8221; said Mike,
&#8220;onless his dad imprisses upon him that it
won&#8217;t be healthy for him to talk too freely
wid his mouth regarding the sarcus he obsarved
this avening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The lookout in front ran off at the first
sign of danger, and if there was a second one
he ran too. It will be a long time before
any member of that party pays Beartown
a second visit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin now made known the fear in his
mind&mdash;a fear that was shared by Chester.
The <i>Deerfoot</i> was lying against the bank in
Back River exposed to any injury which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
these criminals might choose to inflict by
way of revenge. He proposed that the
mother and daughter, after refastening the
window and locking up, should retire to
their beds, while the boys returned to the
launch to make sure no harm befell it.
</p>
<p>This course was only the commonest prudence,
but the hostess and her daughter
were clearly so nervous over being left alone
for the remainder of the night that Alvin
regretted his proposal. Nora especially
did not try to hide her distress.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; Alvin made haste to say,
&#8220;we will wait till morning. You have been
so kind that we cannot willingly cause you
a moment&#8217;s pain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I make a suggistion?&#8221; asked Mike,
speaking so seriously that all knew he was
about to say something worth while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he&#8217;s going to tell us the right
thing,&#8221; said Nora.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I do itherwise wid yer bright
eyes cheering me?&#8221; he asked, with his
expansive grin. &#8220;The same is this: Do
ye two spalpeens go down to the launch and
stay there till morning while I remain behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
wid the misthress and sweet Nora, and keep
off the burglars wid that same gun that
sarved me so well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Only Alvin and Chester knew the chivalry
of this proposal. Mike regretted keenly
the separation from them, even though it
promised to be for only a few hours.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is asking too much,&#8221; said the
widow, though her countenance brightened
with pleasure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can the same be asking too much
whin ye haven&#8217;t asked it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nora clapped her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hilp it if she looks upon mesilf
as worth the two of ye,&#8221; said Mike, with an
assumption of dignity that deceived no one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good on your part, Mike,&#8221; said
Alvin. &#8220;I feel as if we ought to give attention
to the boat, and you may as well stay
here. We&#8217;ll wait for you in the morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t feel obleeged to do the same.
Something may turn up that may cause ye
to hurry off. If it be so, don&#8217;t tarry a
minute for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly you may prove right, but we
shall hate to leave you behind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ye may do so foriver, so long as I have
such quarters as these.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With this understanding, the friends
parted, no one dreaming of what was to
befall them before all met again.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Startling Discovery</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Nothing was more natural than
that Alvin Landon and Chester
Haynes should be concerned for
the safety of the motor launch <i>Deerfoot</i>. It
had been stolen from them once in simple
wantonness by two young men who had
nothing to do with the post office robberies.
The motive for a similar theft was now much
stronger. It was evident that the criminals
had come to Beartown, or as near to it as
they could come, by water, and their boat
was somewhere in the neighborhood. They
were likely to discover the <i>Deerfoot</i>, if they
had not already done so, and knowing its
superior speed, would either make use of or
disable it so it could not be employed for
pursuit.
</p>
<p>Alvin and Chester kept to the road which
connected the landing with the village, for
it was much easier thus to advance than to
pick their way through the pines and firs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
They did not meet a solitary person, for
the night was well along and daybreak near.
When the rickety frame work loomed up
in the moonlight, they turned off into the
shadow of the wood and moved with the
utmost care. All the time they kept within
sight of the gleam of water. Alvin was in
advance, with his comrade close upon his
heels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! here she is!&#8221; was the pleased
exclamation of the Captain a few minutes
later.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she had any visitors while we were
away?&#8221; asked Chester, as the two stepped
down to the margin of the river.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see no signs of it, but we shall have to
examine further.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The launch lay as close to shore as it
had been possible to bring her&mdash;so close
indeed that the two stepped aboard without
use of a plank. The position of the
moon in the sky was such that the shadow
of the trees was cast several feet beyond the
boat, which, as a consequence, was wrapped
in obscurity. Peering here and there, the
youths began a visual search for the evidence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
they did not wish to find. Alvin
tried the covering, which had been drawn
over the cockpit, preliminary to taking the
bunch of keys from his pocket. It slid
back easily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I locked that,&#8221; he said in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember you went through the
motions, but you must have missed it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stepped over, seated himself and
grasped the steering wheel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is wrong here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; whispered Chester.
</p>
<p>The two listened and heard the muffled
exhaust of a launch not far off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes from down stream,&#8221; said Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their boat!&#8221; exclaimed the excited
Alvin. &#8220;They are hurrying off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s chase them!&#8221; added Chester, catching
the glow of his chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Light up and cast off.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Like a Swallow Skimming Close to the Surface.</span>
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Chester quickly fixed the lights, sprang
from the taffrail to shore, untied the loop
of rope, flung it on deck and leaped after it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Alvin had opened the forward deck, which
covered the engine, climbed down and
around to the front and started it. Then
throwing in the clutch the boat quickly
caught the impulse, and the Captain steered
away from shore. While lying against the
bank the nose of the launch was pointed
up the river, and since the noise showed that
the other boat was speeding down stream,
it was necessary to head in that direction.
The sweeping circle carried the craft far
out into the moon glow and the Captain
turned on full power, sending the boat
southward like a swallow skimming close
to the surface.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They got the idea yesterday that the
<i>Water Witch</i> is faster than the <i>Deerfoot</i>.
That was a cute idea of Calvert, but they
will soon learn their mistake. Do you see
anything of her lights?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester stood beside him in the cockpit,
with one hand grasping the top of the wind-shield,
while he peered into the sea of illumination
through which they were plunging.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he answered &#8220;but we must
be gaining fast.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>The water curled over in a graceful half
circle as it was split apart by the sharp
prow. Some of the spray was scattered
over him, though otherwise the river was as
calm as a millpond. The tide was at its turn,
so there was no current. Alvin held to the
middle of the river, where he knew it was
very deep, and he would have timely notice
of every obstruction that could appear.
</p>
<p>Now that the two were fairly started upon
the singular chase, they had time to speculate
as to its probable result. They had
not a firearm on the boat nor had they ever
had one aboard. They were chasing a
party of criminals who were sure to be well
armed. Suppose our young friends overtook
them, what could they do?
</p>
<p>Alvin had a dim idea that having drawn
near enough to discover the <i>Water Witch</i>,
he would keep in sight until others could
intervene. His boat would follow whereever
the fugitive dare lead, and would
never give up. If our young friends could
not attack, they could point out the way
for others. Should the criminals run into
shore, where there was a chance of landing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
without being observed, the pursuers could
be at their heels, and through the nearest
telegraph station raise the hue and cry
that would quickly end in their overthrow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange,&#8221; reflected Alvin, &#8220;that
while we have not meant to have anything
to do with those scamps we are continually
running into them, while Detective Calvert,
who is in this part of the world for that
purpose, can&#8217;t put his hand on them.
If he and his friend, whom we saw at Wiscasset,
and who is an officer of the law also,
were here, we should be sure of doing the
right thing. As it is, it&#8217;s all guesswork.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Light ahead!&#8221; suddenly called Chester
beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right ahead, but closer in shore on the
left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin leaned forward and gazed intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he added as he saw a
white light low down on the water. &#8220;Now
we&#8217;ll show those fellows what the <i>Deerfoot</i>
can do when she tries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flirted over the little lever controlling
the power, and instantly the engine responded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
so fiercely that the launch shivered
from stem to stern. It bounded forward
like a hound freed from the leash, the bow
rising from the impulse, as if it would leap
clear of the water, and seemingly shooting
over it, like an iceboat driven in a hurricane.
</p>
<p>But the launch in front was no laggard.
Whether she increased her speed at sight of
the light which was seemingly hustling
down the river after her, or whether she
simply held her former rate, she was
going at a tremendous pace. Soon leaving
Long Ledge on their right, the pursuer shot
into the broader waters of Montsweag Bay,
only to find the white light seemingly as
far off as ever. Possibly the pursuers had
gained something, but not enough to be
perceptible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have seen us,&#8221; said Chester, from
his station at the front, &#8220;and are putting
in their best licks. We must be going the
limit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is twenty-four miles, but we&#8217;re not
making it, Chester.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The second mate pulled down his cap
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
more snugly, for the motionless air was
turned into a gale, and looked back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? The <i>Deerfoot</i> is
eating up water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be, but she isn&#8217;t getting there
as she ought to,&#8221; insisted Alvin, who, of
course, was more familiar with his boat.
&#8220;Something is the matter with her. She
seems to be doing her best, and yet she lags.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it because of her trouble
yesterday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be, but I was sure she was shipshape
when we left her last night. See
whether we are gaining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester spent several minutes in studying
the position and progress of that white
light, which was gliding with swift smoothness
over the water, and hugging the bank
all the while. When he spoke it was doubtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we have gained a little, say
about six inches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin groped about him for the binoculars,
which he had left on the seat at his
side. By turning the glass over when in use,
one could avail himself of the night lens,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
which was helpful in the gloom. But he
did not find it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;I am
sure I laid it there. I wonder if anyone
visited the boat while we were away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By gracious!&#8221; called Chester from his
station; &#8220;I believe she has stopped!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make sure of it. I should think they
would put out their stern light if they
wanted to elude us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely they don&#8217;t care. Yes; she has
run into shore, where there seems to be
some sort of landing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin swung over the wheel so as to
approach directly from the rear. Since
the other boat had become motionless, he
slackened speed to save the strain upon his
own.
</p>
<p>Everything was now in the vivid moonlight.
The launch drew steadily up to the
landing where the other boat had halted.
Two men were observed moving about as
if making ready to tie up for the remainder
of the night. They showed no interest
in their pursuers, and Alvin sheered off
slightly so as to pass at a distance of several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
rods, and while doing so he made an exasperating
discovery.
</p>
<p>The craft which he had been pursuing
with so much zest was not the <i>Water Witch</i>,
but a small runabout capable of high
speed. The couple on board gave no attention
to the larger craft, and the chagrined
Alvin turned farther out into the bay and
gradually headed up stream again. Chester
came back from the front and chuckled:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a wild goose chase! The next
thing to do is to make after the <i>Nahanada</i>
or the <i>Gardiner</i>. There will be as much
sense in the one as the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Observing the change of course, Chester
inquired:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well go back and pick up
Mike. It seems to be growing light in
the east.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is; a memorable night in our
experience is drawing to a close.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Chester,&#8221; called the Captain,
&#8220;I am sure someone was on this boat
while we were away at Beartown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sudden suspicion took form in his mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is there enough light for you to see the
name on the bow?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a look and tell me what it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chester carefully leaned over and studied
the gilt letters painted on the right of
the prow corresponding to those on the left.
Then he straightened up with a gasp:
</p>
<p>&#8220;As sure as I&#8217;m a living sinner it&#8217;s the
<i>Water Witch</i>!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Through the Fog</span></h3>
</div>

<p>It was an astounding discovery.
</p>
<p>With never a thought of the grotesque
mistake, both youths had boarded the
launch believing it to be the <i>Deerfoot</i>; they
had pursued the imaginary fugitive only to
awaken to the fact that she was not a fugitive,
and that they had unconsciously stolen
the property of the burglars, which must
have been lying so near their own craft
that the slight difference of location was
not noticed.
</p>
<p>Chester stepped down and seated himself
at the elbow of his chum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are only four seats instead of six.
Why didn&#8217;t we notice it before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we were too much occupied
with other things, or rather were both
struck with blindness just then. As Mike
would say, I&#8217;m completely flabbergasted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m with you. What&#8217;s to be done
now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me where the <i>Deerfoot</i> is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask me something easier. She may be
lying where we left her, or twenty miles
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We should have heard her if she came
down stream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have gone up the river and
around into the Sheepscot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And back to the former hiding place
of this boat or to a different one&mdash;the
&#8216;Beautiful Isle of Somewhere,&#8217;&#8221; said Alvin
grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One place will serve as well as another.
I wonder whether there was ever so wonderful
a mix-up of launches since such craft
were known.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin shut off power and the two listened.
From some point miles away came the
hoarse growl of a steam whistle, but all
else was still. He had hoped that they would
hear the <i>Deerfoot&#8217;s</i> exhaust, but nothing
of the kind came to their ears. He flirted
the switch around and resumed the speed
which was not above half a dozen miles an
hour.
</p>
<p>One of the plagues of the Maine coast is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
the dense fogs which sometimes creep far
up the rivers. Such an obscurity now
began settling over Montsweag Bay and
Back River, shutting out the moonlight as
well as the rays of the rising sun. Before
Alvin was aware, he could not see either
shore until he had run far over to the right
and caught a shadowy sight of the pines,
spruce and firs which lined the bank. The
air dripped moisture and, though it was
summer, it grew chilly.
</p>
<p>While gliding slowly forward they heard
a steamer&#8217;s bell, accompanied by occasional
blasts from her whistle. She was feeling
her way down stream and sounding warnings
to other craft. By and by the beat of
her screw and the ripple of the water from
her bow sounded so near that Alvin edged
closer to land. In the heavy mist loomed a
minute later a bulky steamer, surging southward
at sluggish speed, the crew, as seen
for an instant, looking like saturated ghosts.
</p>
<p>The boat was quickly swallowed up, her
bell still tolling, with blasts from her whistle
at short intervals.
</p>
<p>Seated as described, the two youths discussed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
what was the best thing to do. It
seemed advisable to return to the point
from which they started, that is, near Beartown
landing. There was not one chance
in a hundred that they would find the <i>Deerfoot</i>
there, but such a thing was not impossible.
That which made this policy seem
wise was the likelihood of again meeting
Detective Calvert. The news of the attempted
robbery of the Beartown post office
would be telegraphed far and wide, and he
would be sure to hear of it at Wiscasset.
It would not take him and his brother
officer long to reach the village, where the
lads could hope to see him.
</p>
<p>It was certainly a singular coincidence
that the launch should be twice stolen in so
brief a time, and the owner grimly asked
himself whether fate had not ordained that
he was to lose it after all.
</p>
<p>There was no light in the maze of conjecture
that opened before them. Chester
suggested an alarming complication.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Deerfoot</i> can outspeed any craft in
the Maine waters. These burglars must
have a hiding place, and we know there is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
no end to them among the bays, inlets,
coves and islands that stud the rivers.
Suppose they board the launch and speed
away till all pursuit is thrown off the
scent&mdash;something they can easily do&mdash;and
then abandon the boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall find her sooner or later, and
Calvert will perhaps in this way get on their
track.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They can avert such danger by sinking
her in deep water, where she may not be
found for years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not thought of that. It looks as
if they had the whip-hand. These fellows
may have blundered last night, but it was
solely through the sudden appearance of
Mike on the spot, for they are no fools.
If we try to get the best of them we shall
get the worst, unless we have the help of Mr.
Calvert.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the only way to gain that is to go
back to Beartown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems to me. What do you think?&#8221;
asked the Captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know of nothing better. Wouldn&#8217;t
it be well to hit up the pace a little?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If this fog would only lift! But it seems
to be growing thicker. We must feel
our way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While the Captain was doing this, his
second mate looked over the <i>Water Witch</i>.
Its resemblance to the <i>Deerfoot</i> was remarkable.
It was probably two or three feet
shorter, but that was the only noticeable
difference. The model was the same, even
to the color of the paint used. As has
already been said, however, there were only
four seats while the <i>Deerfoot</i> had six. The
similarity of the craft was proved by the
fact that Alvin Landon boarded and ran
it for quite a number of miles before even
the slightest suspicion entered his mind.
</p>
<p>All landmarks were shut from view until,
as may be said, the launch ran against them.
The boys had little or no acquaintance with
the river they were ascending, and only
here and there were they able to identify
certain landings or towns from their previous
study of the map. Alvin knew he was
creeping northward, and sooner or later
must reach the point which he left during
the latter part of the night. Even the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
landing would not be recognized without
close study, and possibly not even then.
</p>
<p>Had not the noise made by the progress
of the launch shut out a certain sound and
had not the dense fog hidden something
from sight, the two would have made a
startling discovery within the hour which
followed their turning back. But no knowledge
of that nature came to them.
</p>
<p>The boys agreed that they would not
reach their destination until long after their
change of course. Neither noted when this
was done, but Chester now looked at his
watch and found it showed a few minutes to
seven.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good hour for breakfast,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;and my appetite is with me, as
I am sure yours is with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin nodded and kept his eye on the
receding shore and the water ahead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike is to be envied, for the good woman
and especially the daughter will give him
the best their house can afford. These
boats don&#8217;t carry a large stock of provisions&mdash;who
knows but there&#8217;s something of the
kind on board?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>He asked the Captain to rise while he
lifted the cushioned lid of the locker upon
which he had been sitting. The next
moment Chester uttered a joyous cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! we&#8217;re in luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held up a large paper bag into which
he had peeped. It contained half a dozen
plump ham sandwiches.
</p>
<p>&#8220;While we are about it suppose we see
what other treasures are in the ship&#8217;s chest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found a most interesting stock indeed.
Five black pieces of muslin, each with
two peep-holes, several sets of false whiskers,
two pairs of brass knuckles, three metal
rings from each of which dangled more
than a dozen keys of varying sizes, a box
of revolver cartridges, a formidable knife,
some twine and a number of articles of no
importance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They tell their story,&#8221; said Chester,
holding them up one after another for his
chum&#8217;s inspection. &#8220;If the officers of the law
arrest us, we shall have to depend upon our
friends to prove an alibi.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile there is no need to keep
those sandwiches waiting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if they are poisoned,&#8221; laughed
Chester, as he passed one to his chum, and
sank his teeth in another. &#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;m
going to take chances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I. They don&#8217;t seem to have any
cooking utensils on board, so coffee and
warm food are to be denied us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Captain ate with one hand on the
steering wheel, and frequent glances ahead.
Now and then they would find themselves
approaching a sharp projection of land,
around which the launch was steered, and
then perhaps would glide past a cunning
looking cove, too narrow to admit a boat
of large size. Once, while doubling a cape,
they came within a hair of running down a
small rowboat propelled by a single occupant.
He shouted angrily for the steersman
to keep a better lookout.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; called back Alvin; &#8220;but the
fog bothers us. Will you please tell me
how far it is to Beartown landing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout half a mile, mebbe a little more.
Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin gave his right name and thanked
the man for his information.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was about the distance,&#8221;
said Chester, as he resumed the duty of
sentinel. &#8220;I can&#8217;t recognize any landmark,
and couldn&#8217;t if there was no fog to
play the mischief with our sight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alvin stopped the engine two or three
times while approaching the spot, in order
to listen for sounds of the other boat.
They heard nothing, but had they not
waited too long to make the experiment,
they would have picked up some exceedingly
interesting information.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the spot!&#8221; called Chester a few
minutes later, as he identified the spiderlike
landing from which a road led to Beartown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we have passed the place where the
launch lay up last night. We may as well
go beyond and be out of the way of folks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A hundred yards north of the wharf, too
far to see it when they looked back, the
<i>Water Witch</i> came gently to rest, the waiting
Chester sprang ashore with a line in
hand and made fast.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Bad for Mike Murphy</span></h3>
</div>

<p>When Gerald Buxton&#8217;s shotgun
was fired by him, and the report
rang out in the still night, it
awoke several persons, who wondered what
it meant. No one gave the matter further
thought, however, until an old lady, facing
the main street, looked through her bedroom
window and saw the citizen chasing
his boy, who toted a gun over his shoulder.
At the first streakings of daylight she
hurried to the Buxton home for the explanation.
Within the following half hour the
majority of the population of Beartown
knew that an attempt had been made to
rob the post office during the night. Then
followed a hurrying thither, for no one could
be satisfied until he had viewed the scene
and talked with the postmistress herself.
</p>
<p>It was the confusion and hurly-burly below
stairs that awoke Mike Murphy early.
He would have left at once to join Alvin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
and Chester if Nora had not forced him to
eat breakfast before bidding them good-by.
It must be said that the Irish youth
did not require much urging to detain
him that long.
</p>
<p>He found he was attracting unpleasant
attention. It was Nora who took pains
to let it be known that but for him all
the money in the safe would have been
stolen. Mr. Jasper, the owner of the large
sum, scrambled through the crowd, snatched
up his big envelope and hurried off without
so much as thanking Mike, who cared
naught.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; said the keeper
of the other grocery store to the husband
of the town milliner. &#8220;That redheaded
Irish chap is one of the gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you account for his preventing
the other robber from carrying away the
money in the safe?&#8221; asked his neighbor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plain enough; they&#8217;d had a quarrel.
He wanted it all for himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he take it then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The widder and others bounced down
on him afore he had the chance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why if the other villain run
away this one didn&#8217;t do likewise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll do it quick enough, never you
fear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is he hanging round after they&#8217;ve
gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To git the money. Seems to me, Rufe,
you&#8217;re blamed stupid this morning. Why,
you&#8217;ve only to take one look at that young
ruffian&#8217;s face to see the wickedness wrote
there. He oughter be in prison this very
minute, and he&#8217;ll soon be there&mdash;take my
word for it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sneaked off while he had the chance&mdash;wal,
I&#8217;ll be gul darned!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The grinning Mike Murphy was standing
at his elbow, where he had heard every
word of the pointed conversation. The
gossip was so taken aback that he began
stammering:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had&mdash;that is, I was thinking of the
other robber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told,&#8221; said Mike, &#8220;that there was
a man hereabouts that looked so much like
me he must be my lost brither that was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
let out of jail in Boston a fortnight since.
I&#8217;ve found him and begs the privilege of
shaking his hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he caught the limp fingers of the
gaping fellow and squeezed them hard, while
he continued to gape and say nothing.
</p>
<p>Since this unpleasant person bore not
the slightest resemblance to the youth,
being pale and effeminate looking, those
who stood near broke into laughter. Mike
turned about, and having bidden good-by
to mother and daughter, passed into the
street and turned down the road leading to
the landing.
</p>
<p>The hour was early and the fog of which
I have spoken was beginning to creep over
the village and through the woods. He
kept his bearings, and when near the river
plunged in among the trees to find the <i>Deerfoot</i>,
remembering where she was moored
the night before.
</p>
<p>Some hours earlier Alvin Landon and
Chester Haynes had boarded the <i>Water
Witch</i>, never doubting that it was the <i>Deerfoot</i>,
and started down the river. Consequently
Mike could not make the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
mistake, and came straight to the launch
with which he was familiar. Standing for a
brief period on the bank he looked admiringly
at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the byes?&#8221; was the first
question he asked himself, as a glance told
him he had arrived ahead of them. &#8220;I
wonder now if they have strayed off in the
woods, where they may wander about
like the two lost babes and be niver heerd
of agin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Not doubting that they would soon show
up, he sat down on the velvety ground to
await them. By and by he became drowsy.
The previous night had been so broken that
he had not gained half the sleep he needed.
It was natural, therefore, after his generous
breakfast, that he should be inclined to
slumber. Rousing up, he reflected:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I fall asleep here, the byes may not
obsarve me and sail away and leave me
behind. I shouldn&#8217;t mind that so much
wid only a quarter of a dollar in me pocket,
fur I could go back to Nora and her mother
and spind the rest of me days. But the
Captain and second mate would graive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
themselves to death, and that would make
me feel bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Throwing off his drowsiness, he rose to
his feet, reached out one hand and sprang
lightly aboard the boat. Seats, cushions,
flags, everything was as they had left it
the night before. He sat down on one
seat, rested his feet upon another and settled
himself for a good nap, indifferent as to
how long it should last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When they come they will obsarve that
I&#8217;m sweetly draaming, and will respict me
enough to refrain from disturbing me, as
Bobbie Burns used to say whin he lay down
beside the road late at night on his way
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His posture was so comfortable that his
head soon bowed and he drifted into the
land of dreams. His first essay was not so
successful as he hoped it would be, for by
and by the nodding head tipped too far
forward, and he sprawled on his face. His
first confused fancy was that he had been
lying in his trundle bed at Tipperary with
his cousin Garry Murphy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, what do ye maan by kicking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
me out on the floor, ye spalpeen? Whin
I git me eyes open I&#8217;ll taich ye better
manners,&#8221; he called, climbing carefully to
his feet. After a brief spell he recalled
the situation. His first fear was that the
Captain and second mate had returned and
witnessed his tumble, but looking around,
he saw nothing of them. The mooring line
lay looped around the base of the spruce
and the launch was motionless.
</p>
<p>Soon after, two persons came stealing
their way among the trees, feeling each
step like a couple of Indian scouts entering
a hostile camp. They were Kit Woodford,
leader of the post office burglars, and his
young companion Graff Miller. You remember
they acted as lookouts, while the
third was busy inside. They had fled like
the cowards they were on the first sign of
danger, had managed to find each other
and then set out to flee in their launch.
What had become of &#8220;Nox&#8221; they did not
know or care. He must do as they had done&mdash;save
himself or go unsaved.
</p>
<p>A shock of astonishment came to the
miscreants when they reached the place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
where the <i>Water Witch</i> was moored the
night before, only to discover that it had
vanished. To the alarmed ruffians there
was but the one explanation: the men
who had interfered with the work at the
post office had learned of the launch and
run off with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rum go!&#8221; was the disgusted
exclamation of Woodford. &#8220;I thought we
should have an easy thing of it, but we&#8217;ve
got to turn back inland. We shouldn&#8217;t have
any trouble, though it looks to me as if
we shall have to part company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The younger man was not favorably
impressed at first, but a moment&#8217;s reflection
convinced him that this was one of
the situations in which the proverb, &#8220;In
union there is strength,&#8221; did not hold good.
Two persons trying together to make their
way out of the neighborhood without
drawing suspicion would be in more danger
than one. So he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I will go down stream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved away from his companion,
who held his place for a brief while, still
reflecting whether his plan was the better
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
one after all. He was turning over the
problem in his mind, when he caught the
sound of a guarded whistle. It was a
familiar call from his companion and he
did not hesitate to follow it. Only a little
way off he paused with an exclamation of
astonishment.
</p>
<p>There was the swift launch <i>Deerfoot</i>
moored against the bank so near the place
where the <i>Water Witch</i> had been left that it
is no wonder that Alvin Landon and Chester
Haynes failed to notice the difference of
location. Not only that, but one of the
youths belonging to the boat was seated
near the stern with head bowed as if asleep.
</p>
<p>What could the amazing fact mean?
Woodford&#8217;s first thought was that a trap
had been set for them. More than likely
the seeming slumber on the part of the
motionless figure was a pretence, and meant
to tempt them to come out into the open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it?&#8221; whispered
Graff Miller.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some deviltry you may be sure; the
others are near by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They stealthily withdrew deeper into the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
wood and watched and listened, but nothing
occurred to cause alarm. Then a sudden
resolution came to the elder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as there&#8217;s only one, let&#8217;s make
him prisoner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; assented the other.
</p>
<p>As silently as two shadows, they stole
to the edge of the water. Woodford deftly
cast off the bow line and, leaning over,
gently laid it on the deck. Then they
stepped aboard and Miller took up the boathook,
pressed it against the bank and the
launch began moving away. When the
boathook could be used no longer, it was
softly laid down and the younger man took
his place at the wheel. He understood the
running of the launch better than his companions
and generally acted as pilot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I start?&#8221; he asked, in a guarded
voice.
</p>
<p>The other nodded. Miller slipped the
switch plug in place, started the motor and
put on the power, with just enough force
to set the screw slowly revolving. He
headed out in the river, where, because of
the fog, he could barely see the flagstaff
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
at the bow, and began a wide sweeping circle
with the intention of descending the stream.
</p>
<p>And still Mike Murphy dreamed on.
</p>
<p>Now that the boat was under way with
the screw revolving faster, Kit Woodford
stepped closer to the sleeping youth and
looked at his face. When he recognized him
as the belligerent Irish lad, his feelings
underwent a sudden change. He knew
something of the sleeper and decided on
the instant that he was <i>persona non grata</i>.
While one of the other boys might have
been held with some vague idea of being
used as a hostage, this one would make
more trouble aboard than on land.
</p>
<p>Without a word as to his purpose to his
companion, Kit Woodford stooped over,
and with the great strength he possessed,
easily lifted the sleeping boy clear of the
deck. Then he cautiously moved to the
taffrail, and with a single toss flung Mike
Murphy clear of the launch. And the water
was fifty feet deep, and Mike had never
swum a stroke, and there was no one to
go to his help.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>What Saved Mike</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Let us be just to all. I therefore make
haste to say that when Kit Woodford
thus threw Mike Murphy into the
Back River he did not doubt for an instant
that he was a swimmer, for whoever heard
of a lusty youth seventeen years old who
could not take care of himself in water?
Of course there are such, but they are so
few that they are a negligible number.
</p>
<p>Graff Miller was startled when he heard
the splash, and turning his head saw the lad
disappear, but his belief was the same as his
companion&#8217;s, and turning on more power,
he shot beyond sight before the lad could
come to the surface.
</p>
<p>Now I wish to say further that it is a
fact within the knowledge of more than one
that a person who did not know how to swim
has, upon being precipitated into deep water,
struck out like a master of the natatorial
art. A father standing on the shore of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
lake in northern England saw a boat upset
when a hundred yards off and his little boy
flung clear of the support. The lad had
never even tried to swim, but as he was
going down the parent shouted to him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t come right to land, I&#8217;ll
whip you within an inch of your life!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the little fellow swam to where the
frantic parent awaited him.
</p>
<p>Moreover, I once witnessed the same
strange occurrence. I was not six years old
when I was waiting at the side of a deep
pond, and watching my brother, four years
older, construct a raft, with which he had
promised to come over and take me a-sailing.
He put a number of boards loosely together,
and using a shingle for a paddle, worked
out from shore and began making his way
toward me, who was in high spirits over the
promised treat.
</p>
<p>In the very middle of the pond, where the
water was fully twenty feet deep, the primitive
raft began disintegrating. The boards
slipped apart, so that those upon which
my brother stood sank under his weight.
Had he been older and more sensible, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
would have known that this need not mean
danger to him, for the smallest board was
buoyant enough to hold his head above
water, and he could have worked his way
to land with such support. But the sight
of the structure breaking apart threw him
into a panic. He made a frenzied leap as
far out as he could, came up instantly,
blew the water from his mouth and swam
so easily to where I was standing that I
never dreamed he was in peril. I should
have said that never before had he tried
to swim.
</p>
<p>The explanation of what seems unaccountable
is simple. Now and then it
happens that when a sudden demand is
made upon a person to save his life by
swimming he instinctively does the right
thing. He adjusts his body correctly, and
uses his legs and arms properly&mdash;his action
being exactly like those of a bullfrog when
he starts on a voyage to the other side of
the spring where he makes his home.
</p>
<p>This thing does not often occur, but, as
I have said, it does now and then. Let me
beg you never to make the experiment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
unless it is forced upon you, for I dread
what the result would be.
</p>
<p>You have already guessed that this is
what took place with Mike Murphy. I
cannot think of a more startling awaking
than that of a sleeping person who is flung
into a deep stream of very cold water.
Mike&#8217;s momentum took him several feet
below the surface, but he quickly rose again,
shook the water from his eyes, blew it out
of his mouth, and then swam straight
for land with the skill that you would show
in a similar situation. Even in taking the
right direction he was providentially guided,
for at first the dense fog shut everything
from sight, but after a few strokes, he saw
the dim outlines of the trees, and never
stopped the vigorous swimming until he
reached up, grasped an overhanging limb
of a near-by tree and felt his feet touch
bottom.
</p>
<p>And then he was so overcome by what had
taken place and it was so beyond his comprehension
that he believed it was a miracle.
Standing on the bank in his dripping clothing,
he was mute for a full minute. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
he sank on his knees and looking reverently
upward said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father,
for saving me life when I didn&#8217;t desarve
it. Why Ye took the trouble is beyond
me, but I niver can thank Thee enough.
I&#8217;m going to try me bist to be more desarving
of Yer kindness, and now if it&#8217;s all the
same to Yer blissed silf, plaise give me a
chance at that spalpeen that treated me as
he did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>From down the river came the sound
of the <i>Deerfoot&#8217;s</i> exhaust, growing fainter
as the boat sped on its way. The hoarse
blast of a steamer&#8217;s whistle shuddered
through the mist, but the lad saw nothing
of either craft. It was fog, fog on every
hand.
</p>
<p>He could not straighten out in his mind
all that had taken place. More than one
phase of the occurrences was beyond explanation.
Overcoming in a degree the awe
he felt for what had occurred in his own
person, he thought:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Captain and second mate didn&#8217;t
know I couldn&#8217;t swim, I&#8217;d belave it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
them that dropped me overboard by way
of a joke, as the Barry brithers explained to
the Judge was their raison for hanging
Black Mike. It was thim spalpeens that
wint fur the Captain whin he was journeying
through the woods. Begorra! but they are
piling up a big debt fur me to pay! But
I&#8217;ll sittle the same wid int&#8217;rist at siven
thousand per cent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Alvin and Chester all this time?
Why didn&#8217;t they git to the <i>Deerfut</i> before
me instead of laving it fur them chaps?
What does it all maan, anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the singular coincidences of this
series of adventures was that the <i>Deerfoot</i>
in going down the Back River passed within
a few rods of the <i>Water Witch</i> coming up.
The noise of the respective engines prevented
either party hearing the other, and
the fog would have veiled them had the
space between been considerably less.
</p>
<p>Not knowing that the launch of their
enemies had been moored anywhere near,
Mike did not look for it. Ignorant also of
how far he had been carried while asleep,
he could not guess the distance to Beartown
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
landing. It might be half a mile or
ten times as much. In truth, the former
distance was about right.
</p>
<p>The pressing question was as to what he
should do. His clothing even to his cap
was saturated. The morning was chilly,
and he shivered. He must find a place
where he could obtain warmth until his
garments dried. When that was done he
would decide upon the next step to take.
</p>
<p>Had he suspected that he was so close to
the landing, he would have picked his way
thither and then followed the road to the
home of Mrs. Friestone. It seemed to him
that there must be a good many scattered
houses, any one of which would give him
welcome. He remembered that a broad
highway runs the whole length of big Westport
Island. Necessarily this was parallel
with the course of Back River. If he therefore
turned away from the latter and held
a direct course, he must sooner or later
reach the road named, where he would be
sure soon to receive hospitality.
</p>
<p>No doubt you know from experience how
hard it is to hold a straight course when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
going through a wilderness, without landmarks
to guide you and ignorant also of
the &#8220;signs&#8221; which are as plain as print to
the veteran hunter. The fog inclosed Mike
on every hand, but his activity imparted
a pleasant warmth to his frame, which
otherwise would not have been felt, even
though it was summer time.
</p>
<p>He zigzagged sometimes to the right and
sometimes to the left, but, on the whole,
held substantially to the right direction
and gradually drew near the dusty avenue
which, once reached, would bring the end
of his discomforts. Good fortune stayed
with him, for when he was beginning to
feel somewhat discouraged with his failure
to free himself from the dripping woods, he
abruptly came upon a clearing, in the midst
of which stood a small house, surrounded by
a well-tilled garden and several smaller
buildings. Chickens were scratching and
picking at the earth, and a big dog, fortunately
restrained by a chain, scrambled
out of his kennel at sight of the stranger
and barked and tugged to get at him.
</p>
<p>Between him and Mike stretched a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
clothesline supported at intervals by leaning
props, and despite the fact that the
humidity in the air must have been close
to ninety-nine degrees, a corpulent woman
was hanging out clothes. Two or three
wooden pins were in her mouth, and every
now and then she reached up with one hand
and squeezed the little conveniences over
the cord which supported the flapping
clothes. She wore no bonnet or hat, and
the untied shoes evidently were an old pair
belonging to her husband.
</p>
<p>Hearing the dog bark, she looked around
to learn the cause. She saw a freckle-faced
youth in the act of doffing his cap and
bowing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The top of the morning to yer ladyship,
and would ye be willing to hang me across
yer line till me clothes be dried?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman snatched the pins from between
her teeth and stared at him. Her
face was broad, homely and good-natured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;way now,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;I don&#8217;t
hang up any clothes till the same is <i>claan</i>.
It will take a waak&#8217;s washing to rinder ye
fit. If I straddle ye over the line wid yer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
faat and rid head hanging down and bumping
togither, ye&#8217;ll cut a purty figger a-flapping
in the wind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s laughter rang out. She was
Irish like him and his heart warmed to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Begorra! I&#8217;ve met a leddy after me
own heart. She&#8217;s from the &#8216;owld sod&#8217; and
it&#8217;s not mesilf that is going to have me own
way in gay conversation wid the charming
beauty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>True enough, the woman was his match
and Mike was glad to learn it.

<p>She looked sharply at him through her
bright blue eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are ye saaking to make me belave
ye are from Ireland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartinly&mdash;Mike Murphy, from the town
of Tipperary, County of Tipperary, at your
sarvice,&#8221; and he bowed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, poor Ireland, how many wrongs
are heaped upon ye! I was sure from yer
accint that ye were a Dutchman or Frinch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask yer name, me leddy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Maggie McCaffry, and me husband
is Tam that is working for Mr. Burns
at Beartown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike clasped his hands and with a glowing
expression stepped forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed it! I knowed it!&#8221; he exclaimed,
as if overrunning with joy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowed phwat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That ye were my mither&#8217;s fourth cousin
that lift Tipperary fur Noo York six years

jail&mdash;bad cess to them as made the same
mistake!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough fur ye to be born in
the same counthry wid mesilf, but I war-r-n
ye to make no claim to relationship. There&#8217;s
some things a respictable leddy can&#8217;t stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did ye not almost break me heart by
thinking I was a Dutchman?&#8221; asked Mike
reprovingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make the same roight by axing the
pardon of ivery Dutchman I maats for the
rist of me born days. &#8217;Twas har-r-d on the

of yer fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, what are ye saying? Five
cints is no object to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then, in spite of an effort to prevent it,
Mike&#8217;s teeth chattered. Now that he had
ceased walking he quickly became chilled.
The woman noticed it and her warm sympathy
instantly welled up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a shame that I kipt ye talking
nonsense wid me while ye was shivering.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Do ye walk straight into the house and
war-r-m yersilf till I come, which will be in
a jiffy whin I have the rest of me clothes
hung out. And if ye&#8217;re hungry ye shall have
food.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank ye, aunty, but I am not in
need of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Two small wooden steps were in front
of the only door on that side of the neat
little cottage. He pressed his thumb on
the latch, pushed open the door and the
next instant faced one of the greatest
surprises of his life.
</p>
<p>The lower floor consisted of two rooms, a
kitchen and a general living room. The fire
in the former would have been enough for the
interior, but for the fact that a visitor had
preceded Mike, and because of his presence
a roaring fire was burning on the hearth. In
front of this sat a young man leaning back
in a rocking chair, with a bandaged leg
resting on a pillow laid upon a second chair
in front of him. He was smoking a cigarette,
and despite the fact that something ailed
him, looked quite comfortable.
</p>
<p>As the door opened, his eyes met those of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Mike Murphy, who halted with one foot
over the threshold, started and exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I belave what me eyes tell me! Is
it <i>yersilf</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The young man sitting before him, smoking
and nursing his injured limb, was Orestes
Noxon, whom Mike chased away from the
Beartown post office the night before, and
who received a part of the charge from the
shotgun of Gerald Buxton.
</p>
<p>The face of the injured youth flushed and
he laughed nervously, but with amazing
coolness answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you don&#8217;t need spectacles.
You&#8217;ve got the best of me; I&#8217;m down and
you&#8217;re up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an old account to be squared
atween us, but that can rist till ye become
yersilf. Be the same token, are ye much
hurt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s Irish sympathy immediately went
out to the fellow, who certainly was at
his mercy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I am. But your clothing is
wet. I heard a part of your talk with Mrs.
McCaffry&mdash;God bless her splendid soul!&mdash;so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
suppose you come closer where you will be
in front of the fire and can dry yourself,
and we&#8217;ll get on better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was good advice and Mike acted upon
it. Standing with his back to the blaze, he
looked down in the face of the criminal
whose self-possession he could not help
admiring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember our little foot race from
the back of the Beartown post office?&#8221;
said Noxon, as if referring to an incident
in which he felt no particular interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, but I niver won a prize at running
and ye give me the slip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to get in front of that beefeater
with a shotgun. Why didn&#8217;t you fire when
you were chasing and threatening me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have touched off that busted
gun any more than I could have fired a
broom handle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I made the mistake of thinking the other
fellow would be equally forbearing and kept
on running, till all at once, bang! he let
drive. I caught a good part of the charge
in that leg below the knee. It didn&#8217;t hurt
much at first, and after managing to get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
hold of his gun I made him dance for me.
It would have killed you to see him,&#8221; and
at the recollection the young man laughed
hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His boy Jim obsarved it all and told us
and we laughed,&#8221; said Mike, with a grin.
&#8220;The sight must have been very insthructive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, to that old codger, who won&#8217;t
get over his lesson for a month. Well, as
the gun wasn&#8217;t of any use to me I threw it
away and started to find my friends and
the boat we came on. By and by my leg
began to hurt, I suppose from walking so
much and a tumble I got by catching my
foot in the root of a tree. I sat down to rest
awhile and when I got up it hurt so badly
that I thought it was all up with me. You
know it was night, and somehow I had gone
astray in the infernal pine woods. The
wound was bleeding, and I sat down again
intending to wait till morning. By and by
I heard a dog bark so near that I climbed to
my feet again and made by way to this
house. McCaffry and his wife were asleep
and it took a good deal of banging and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
shouting for me to wake them. But when
they found out what was the matter
they took me in, and my own father and
mother could not have been kinder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did they do fur yer fut?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The good woman not only washed the
wound, but, by the light of the lamp which
her husband held, picked out every one of
the shot that had been buried there and
were making the trouble. Then she bathed
the hurt again and wrapped it about with
the clean linen, as you see for yourself. All
that remains is for me to keep quiet for a
few days and nature will do the rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be well if I got a docther
fur ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon looked up in the face of the Irish
youth, who tried to keep a grave countenance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; replied the sufferer.
</p>
<p>There was a world of significance in the
words, and both understood.
</p>
<p>Strange that these two who had never
met before except as the bitterest of enemies
should talk now as comrades. Mike kept
pinching his clothing and turning every side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
to the blaze, thus drying the garments quite
rapidly. He was so interested in the story
of Noxon that he grew careless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I see smoke coming from behind
you,&#8221; finally said the sitter.
</p>
<p>Mike reached back to investigate and
with a gasp snatched back his fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afire! Is there a well outside that
I can dive into the same?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn around; I can help you,&#8221; said
Noxon, laughing, dropping his foot and sitting
forward.
</p>
<p>Together they quenched the twist of
blaze which if left alone would have played
the mischief with Mike&#8217;s garments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking this is a little different,
Mr. Noxon, from last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, and I hope it will always stay
that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike was astonished and looked questioningly
at the fellow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phwat might ye be maaning?&#8221; he asked,
lowering his voice.
</p>
<p>Noxon tried to speak, but his voice broke.
He snatched out his handkerchief from the
side pocket of his coat and pressed it to his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
eyes. Then his breast heaved and he
broke into sobbing.
</p>
<p>The heart of Mike melted at the sight.
He had never dreamed of anything like
this. Enmity and resentment gave way to
an anguish of sympathy for the fellow. He
longed to say something comforting, but
could not think of a word, and remained
mute. Very soon the youth regained his
self-control. Dropping his handkerchief in
his lap, and with eyes streaming, he exclaimed
from the very depths of his
despair:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why didn&#8217;t that man aim better and
kill me! I&#8217;m not fit to live! I&#8217;m the worst
villain unhanged! I am lost&mdash;damned, and
a curse to those who love me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mike pulled himself together sufficiently
to reply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think ye&#8217;re quite all them things.
Cheer up! cheer up, old fellow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon did not speak, but slowly swayed
his head from side to side, like one from
whom all hope had departed. Mike drew
a chair beside him, and as tenderly as a
mother lifted the white hand from where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
it lay on the handkerchief, and held it in
his own warm grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noxy, me bye, Mike Murphy is yer
frind through thick and thin&mdash;don&#8217;t ye forget
<i>that</i>&mdash;and I&#8217;m going to see ye through
this if I have to break a thrace in trying.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You!</i>&#8221; repeated the despairing one,
looking up in Mike&#8217;s honest blue eyes.
&#8220;No one can save a wretch like me. I&#8217;m
not worth saving!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye forget there&#8217;s One to whom the same
is aisy, me bye. Ye feel down in the mouth
jest now, as Jonah did respicting the whale,
but bimeby this fog will clear away and
the sun will shine forth again. I&#8217;ve been
in some purty bad scrapes mesilf and He
niver desarted me. Why, it ain&#8217;t two
hours, since He raiched out His hand,
grabbed me by the neck and saved me from
drowning. I tell ye, Noxy, that He won&#8217;t
fail ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you never did what I have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Irish youth bent his head as if recalling
his past life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I did, but I&#8217;m the meanest
scamp that iver lived&mdash;barring yersilf,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
he added, with the old twinkle in his eyes.
&#8220;Come, now, be a man and we&#8217;ll have ye
out of this scrape as quick as I jumped
awhile ago whin I awoke to the fact that
me trousers was afire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon actually smiled at the recollection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You call yourself a scamp. Why, you
are an angel compared with me&mdash;so is
everybody! Kit Woodford and Graff Miller
are a thousand times better than I.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>An Unwelcome Caller</span></h3>
</div>

<p>With rare wisdom Mike now gave
an abrupt turn to the conversation.
Lowering his voice to a
confidential tone, he asked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Mrs. McCaffry know anything of
this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, she hasn&#8217;t given me any reason to
suspect it,&#8221; replied Noxon, brightening up
and seizing the straw held out to him.
&#8220;I told her I had met with an accident, and
neither she nor her husband asked a question.
Their big hearts had no room for
any feeling other than of pity for the
one who is not deserving of a particle
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me her husband works in
Beartown. He wint there airly this morning;
he&#8217;ll hear of the throuble at the post
office and the beefeater, as ye call him,
will let everybody know he winged the
robber as he was running off. Did ye spake
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
any caution to the man before he lift this
morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By good luck I thought of that. I
asked him to make no mention of my being
at his house and he promised me he would
not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now, but that&#8217;s good, as me dad
says whin he tips up the jug. All that ye
have to do is to sit here and let Mrs.
McCaffry nurse that game leg till ye&#8217;re
able to thravel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, if that was <i>all</i>! But I have a father
and mother whose hearts I am breaking.
I have two younger brothers and a sweet
sister. What of <i>them</i>!&#8221; demanded Noxon
almost fiercely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye have read the blissed story of the
Prodigal Son, haven&#8217;t ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a thousandfold worse than that
poor devil, who was simply foolish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do yer dad and mither know where
ye are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the one decent thing I did when
I turned rascal was to change my name.
Orestes Noxon is a <i>nom de plume</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the fellow, but that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
shows, me bye, ye ain&#8217;t such a big fool as
ye look. I&#8217;m beginning to have hope for
ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A strange impulse came to Mike. It was
to sing in a low, inexpressibly sweet voice
a single stanza of a familiar hymn, just
loud enough for the one auditor to hear.
But he restrained himself, fearing the
effect upon him. The &#8220;fountains of the
deep&#8221; were already broken up, and the
result might be regrettable. At that moment
a heavy tread sounded on the little
steps outside, the door was pushed inward,
and the bulky form of the red-faced Mrs.
McCaffry filled the whole space. She
now stepped awkwardly and ponderously
within.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I begs that ye&#8217;ll oxcoose me for not
coming in wid this blarney and inthrodoocing
ye to aich ither. Have ye becoom
acquainted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an oversight which no Irish
leddy should be guilty of,&#8221; gravely replied
Mike, &#8220;espicially whin the same is the
fourth cousin of me own mither. But ye
have been away from the owld counthry so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
long that ye have forgot a good deal, Aunt
Maggie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t furgot to resint the insult of
being accused of relationship wid the family
of a spalpeen that is proud of the belaif.
Whin Tam coomes home to-night I&#8217;ll explain
the insult to him and lave ye two to
sittle the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful ye give me due notice,
Aunt Maggie, so that I&#8217;ll have time to slip
outside and climb a tree. Which reminds
me to ask how fur it is to Beartown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good half mile from our home, and
nigh about the same distance back. Ye
can figger out the rist for yersilf. Now,
me darlint,&#8221; said she, coming to Noxon&#8217;s
chair and bending over with her broad
face radiating sympathy, &#8220;it&#8217;s toime I had
a look at that leg, which would be a
big ornamint if bestowed on the spalpeen
wid the freckles and rid hair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it can need any attention,&#8221;
said Noxon, pleased to listen to the sparring
of the two; &#8220;but you are the doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her hands were big and red, but no
professional nurse could have handled a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
patient with more gentle deftness. The
linen was unwound, and Mike for the first
time inspected the wound inflicted by Gerald
Buxton with his shotgun. Little as the
lad knew of such things, he saw the hurt
was not serious. With the removal of the
leaden pellets went the cause of irritation.
The stumble in the woods had aggravated
the wound temporarily, but a rest for even a
day would render it safe for the young man
to use the leg.
</p>
<p>When the bandage had been repinned
in place, Noxon felt that he was being
coddled more than was necessary. Dropping
his foot to the floor, he asked impatiently:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the sense of my playing baby?
I can walk as well as ever. All I need is an
ordinary cane. I think I&#8217;ll stay with you
till after dinner, Aunt Maggie&mdash;I suppose
I may call you that&mdash;and then I&#8217;ll vamose
the ranch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The woman stared wonderingly at Mike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do ye know what he maanes by thim
words? His mind I fear is afther wandering.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He wishes to say that ye and Tam have
used him so well that he will take delight
in spinding siveral days wid ye.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now his mind isn&#8217;t afther wandering
when he do spake that way. All roight,
me cherub, ye&#8217;ll stay where you be till I
give you liberty to lave. Do ye mind
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she shook her stubby finger in his
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, what a tyrant you are, Aunt
Maggie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phwat&#8217;s that?&#8221; she demanded, straightening
up. &#8220;Are ye calling me out of me
name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the sweetest, kindest, most
motherly woman and best wife in the State
of Maine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet and lumbered to
the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t finished hanging me duds;
whin I have I&#8217;ll come back and wipe out the
insoolt ye have put upon me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon looked at Mike, who for the first
time heard him laugh with real jollity in
his voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a big heart! How unutterably
ashamed she makes me feel! What can I
weigh in the balance against her? She is
pure gold and I am base dross.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forgit to include mesilf wid the
dross, me bye. Ye won&#8217;t be able to get
away from this here place for a few days,
I guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad should I be if I could believe it
safe to stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her husband has already heard all
about last night&#8217;s business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He promised ye to say nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When he did that, he had no suspicion
of who I am. He will know that I was
one of the gang and his disposition will
be far different when he comes home to-night.
In fact, he is likely to feel freed
of any promise he made me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t know a real Irishman. I
can&#8217;t say how he will be disposed, but I
know he&#8217;ll kaap that pledge. Have no
fear of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon sitting back in his chair and apparently
without any thought of his injured
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
leg, pondered earnestly over the
situation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am disposed to believe as you do,
but that isn&#8217;t my only danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phwat have ye in mind now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be lots of people scouring
the country for the three persons who were
in this business. We are so near Beartown
that some of them are likely to call here
before the day is over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This house stands well back from the
road wid only a path betwaan the two.
Why should anyone sarch here fur ye?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why should they not? I shouldn&#8217;t
dare to stay here while this is going on.
However, you have shown such goodwill
toward me, I am willing to compromise. I&#8217;ll
stay till to-night and then must make a
change of base.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whither will ye go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought of that. My aim
will be simply to get out of the zone of
danger, and what follows must depend upon
circumstances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noxy, will ye answer me one question?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&#8220;When ye lave here will ye be going back
to Kit Woodford and Graff Miller?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The eyes of the young man flashed and,
with an earnestness that seemed deadly in
its intensity, he said hoarsely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! never! I&#8217;ll die first!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me yer hand on that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed as if the grip would crush the
clasping fingers. The pressure continued
for nearly a minute, while the two looked
fixedly into each other&#8217;s eyes. The pledge
had been made and into each heart stole
the warm, irradiating glow that God gives
to all the children of men when they break
loose from evil and cling to that which is
good.
</p>
<p>And then the young man gave Mike
his confidence. Aunt Maggie, with a tact
that was creditable to her, left them together
most of the forenoon and their talk was comparatively
free from interruption.
</p>
<p>As Noxon had hinted, he was the eldest
son of parents who were in prosperous circumstances.
He did not give their name nor
place of residence, for it was unnecessary,
but he admitted he had been wayward from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
early boyhood. He longed for wild adventure,
and caused his family grief and anguish
by his persistent wrongdoing. Finally,
when he had matriculated at Yale, he ran
away from home, taking what funds he
could steal and fully resolved upon a life
of sin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there were pirates to-day, as there used
to be, I should have striven to become the
chief of a crew that flew the black flag, but
I had to give that up. Some humorist has
said that when a man starts to go to the
devil he finds everything greased. So it
proved with me. I fell in with Graff Miller,
who, though he is about my age, has been
a burglar for several years. I never suspected
it until he found I was hunting for
such a companion, when he told me of his
partnership with Kit Woodford. In my
vanity, I had shown how easy it was for
me to open one of the old-fashioned combination
safes, by detecting the working
of the mechanism inside. This made me
invaluable to them, and they proposed that
I should become the third member of the
gang. I jumped at the chance. Since
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
Miller told me they used aliases instead of
their right names, I took the one by which
you know me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Their plan was to visit different points
in the south of Maine, where there had been
a number of post office robberies, and use
me to open the safes. I was delighted
with the scheme, and we started in a few
weeks ago. The Beartown post office was
the third visited&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then a knock sounded on the door.
Both were startled and Mike called:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The door was pushed inward and Stockham
Calvert entered the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy smoke!&#8221; exclaimed Mike, &#8220;as
Father Malone said when he saw his church
burning.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Plucking a Brand From the Burning</span></h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good day, my friends!&#8221; was the
greeting of the detective as he
closed the door behind him,
strode forward and saluted Mike, who,
after his exclamation, rose from his chair
and, open mouth and staring eyes, limply
clasped the hand that was offered him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t looking for you, Mike, but I
was searching for Hor&mdash;I beg pardon,
Orestes Noxon. I hope I see you well,
barring the slight injury to the leg inflicted
by Mr. Gerald Buxton last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And what did the officer do but shake
hands with Noxon, who kept his seat as
if in a daze? Mike, who was watching the
couple, instantly noted a significant fact.
Beyond question the two were acquaintances.
The face of the young man flushed
scarlet and he said faintly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Calvert, you have got me at
last.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and a right merry chase you have
led me. You won&#8217;t get away this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Mike,&#8221; said the caller, drawing
up a chair for himself. &#8220;I have something
I would like very much to say to thee,
Orestes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment Aunt Maggie swung
through the door again. She had seen the
man enter and wished to know what it
meant. Calvert sprang to his feet and
bowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have found a couple of good friends
of mine, who I am sure are greatly indebted
to you for your hospitality. One cannot
fail to tell by your looks that you have a
wonderfully kind heart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, now,&#8221; replied Mrs. McCaffry,
pushing away the hair in front of her face
with her fat hand, &#8220;but ye are the worst
blarney of thim all. I&#8217;ll have nothing to
do wid ye till dinner time, whin I&#8217;ll stuff
ye all so full of roast pig and praties that
ye&#8217;ll be obleeged to kaap quiet regarding
dacent folks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She knew the three wished to talk over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
private matters, and made sure they were
left alone for the next hour or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Calvert,&#8221; said Noxon, &#8220;Mike here
has proved himself a true friend to me&mdash;so
you may talk freely before him. He
doesn&#8217;t know my right name and says he
doesn&#8217;t care to know. So we will let that
pass. What caused you to look here for
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Warner Hagan met me in Wiscasset
yesterday to give what help he could in
running Kit Woodford and his gang to
earth. Early this morning we heard of
the attempted robbery of the Beartown
post office. We hired a launch and got
there as soon as we could. Nobody in
Beartown suspects our business. It did
not take us long to pick up all that was
known. We learned that one of the three
got peppered with bird shot, and managed
to limp off in the woods. Of course I recognized
the three young gentlemen who were
accepting the hospitality of Mrs. Friestone,
the postmistress. They required no immediate
attention and were sure to turn
up all right in the end.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I left Hagan in Beartown to look into
matters further while I set out to hunt for
the fellow who had limped off in the woods,
after turning the tables so cleverly on Mr.
Buxton. Without any reason that I could
explain I formed the suspicion that this
member of the gang was you, Noxon (I
believe that is your travelling name). It
was represented that he was hurt much
worse than I am glad to say was the fact.
I inquired at each house along the road
between here and Beartown and hit it at
last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; added the visitor as if seated
with his intimate friends, &#8220;since you tell
me to talk freely in Mike&#8217;s presence, I
shall do so. Are you ready, Noxon, to go
to your home with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Begging yer pardin, Mr. Calvert, I
beg to say that has been sittled. The dearest
hope of Noxy&#8217;s heart is to return to his
parents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; asked the detective of the
young man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give my right hand,&#8221; he
solemnly replied, holding it up, &#8220;if I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
could go back three months in my life and
have things as they were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that as regards time, but
it will bring sunshine and happiness to
your loved ones when the wandering boy
comes to their waiting arms. All being
true, we have got to travel the &#8216;rocky road
to Dublin.&#8217; You have committed a serious
crime against the United States laws, and
if convicted nothing can save you from a
long term in prison.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what hope is there for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been convicted yet, but
I won&#8217;t deny that you are in serious danger
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How shall I escape?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that over while on the road
from Beartown. This, I believe, is your
third essay as a burglar. Am I right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Once would be enough to send you to
Atlanta, but let that go for the present. Are
you willing to turn state&#8217;s evidence?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon moved uneasily in his seat. The
proposition was distasteful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t feel any compunctions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Kit Woodford and that cub who calls
himself Graff Miller have handed out the
double cross many a time, and stand ready
to do it again if it promises the slightest
advantage to them. They have run off in
the hope of taking care of their own hides,
without caring the snap of a finger what
became of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no mistake about <i>that</i>, Mr. Calvert?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t deceive you for an instant.
Their own actions prove it. They have
done the same thing before, and to-day they
did not give you a thought, when danger
threatened them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall do whatever you wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! You may not know that, although
I am a Pinkerton detective, I am under
promise to my lifelong friend to do all I
can to save you from yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does father know I am in this business,
Mr. Calvert?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t dream of such a thing.
The shock would kill him. Therefore, I
shall strain every nerve to keep him from
ever learning the truth. I have a plan in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
mind, but before trying it you must answer
a few questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, where do this gang
with whom you have been associated have
their headquarters?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can guide you to the exact spot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not that little patch of ground in
the cove at the southern end of Barter
Island?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the character of the islet forbids.
Miller ran the launch in there one night
when he thought some one was watching,
to throw him off the scent. Have you a
pencil and bit of paper anywhere about
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Calvert produced the articles from an
inner coat pocket and handed them to
Noxon. Placing the paper on the table in
the middle of the room, he spent several
minutes in drawing a diagram. He was
apt at the work and did it with no little
skill. By and by he handed paper and
pencil to the owner with the remark:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will answer your question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a production of art,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
detective admiringly. &#8220;No professional
artist could beat it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Noxon had not only drawn a perfect
representation of the neighborhood which
he had in mind, but lettered it so that no
mistake was possible. It pictured a part
of the eastern shore of Westport Island,
opposite Barter, and only a short distance
north of the inlet where the <i>Water Witch</i> had
been visited some nights before. Noxon
leaned forward and placed the tip of his
finger on the different points.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right there is one of a hundred similar
coves among the waters of southern Maine.
It is smaller than the others, and a little
way back is an island, which resembles
except in size those that you see in every
part of these waters. You know they rise
above the surface like vast bouquets, with
trees growing down to the edge of the river
or sea. It is not so with that bit of earth
you first asked about, but it is so with the
islet in that cove which I show on that
piece of paper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about this one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what you may call the headquarters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
of the Woodford gang of post office robbers.
And, yet, it seems hardly right to
call it that, for it is sort of hiding place to
which they flee when things begin to grow
warm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Several times. I will go again with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No need; I can&#8217;t go wrong with such
directions. Why, Mike himself can understand
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gravely held up the drawing before
the Irish youth, who squinted one eye
and carefully scrutinized it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must say I don&#8217;t make sure whither
it&#8217;s a picter of yersilf, Mr. Calvert, or a
view of an automobile trying to climb
a tree.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you, Orestes? Isn&#8217;t
he bright?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An unnicessary question,&#8221; said Mike
loftily; &#8220;as Auntie McCaffry would answer
if ye asked her which was the handsomest
and cutest and smartest one among her
three guests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noxon,&#8221; said Calvert, with a smile
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
over the repartee of the Irish lad, &#8220;do either
Kit Woodford or Graff Miller know your
right name?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They never asked me and it was never
given in their presence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said as much before. Do they
know where you came from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t the slightest knowledge.
I am as unknown to them as regards my
real identity as if I never existed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will help my plan, which, I may
say to you and Mike, is simply this: get
you out of this neighborhood to your home.
There, of course, you will assume your
true identity and no one need ever be the
wiser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What of the testimony of Woodford
and Miller when they are released from
jail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and they will be so much older
that neither will recognize the other. Have
no fear on that score. The thing is to run
you out of the State of Maine. The hunt
for these post office robbers has become so
hot that it isn&#8217;t going to be an easy job,
but I believe I can work it. There&#8217;s some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
sort of a mix-up of motor boats, which as
yet I can&#8217;t get the hang of, but when I
do I shall try my plan. Mike, how was it
you were here with Noxon when I called?
Can you tell me anything about your launch
or the <i>Water Witch</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thereupon the Irish youth related his
story, and when it was finished the detective
smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m not mistaken that is going to
help us a big lot.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Beautiful Isle of Somewhere</span>&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Detective Stockham Calvert was
quick to make deductions and as
quick in adapting himself to circumstances.
He had said he did not expect
to have the help of Orestes Noxon&mdash;as we
must continue to call him&mdash;in capturing
the two criminals, but ten minutes later
he made a radical change of plans. He
meant to make use of the young man, in
his pursuit of the post office robbers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must leave here at once,&#8221; he
announced in his crisp manner. &#8220;Searching
parties are out and some of them are
likely to call here at any time. Since
Noxon worked with his face masked, except
when the slip occurred last night, it is not
likely, he would be recognized by any of
those who are looking for him. But there
is a risk which we must avoid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. McCaffry made strong objection
to their leaving before the dinner hour,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
but the officer assured her it could not be
helped. He and Noxon compelled her to
accept liberal tips, but she refused to take
the last remaining quarter of Mike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same would bring me bad luck,&#8221;
she said, with a shake of her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could it do that whin it brought
me the bist of luck, being I came to your
door?&#8221; asked the youth, trying to press it
upon her; but she would not consent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s mesilf that&#8217;s of no
more account than a naught wid no circle
round it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Instead of following the path that led to
the highway and so on to Beartown,
Calvert turned into the woods through
which his companions had made their way
to the humble but hospitable home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep clear of the village,&#8221; he
explained, &#8220;for every one there is in a fever
of excitement, and although I can do my
part in the way of prevarication, I don&#8217;t
wish to be driven to the limit, when it
might not, after all, avert trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fogs which often plague the coast of
Maine and vicinity have a habit of sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
leaving as suddenly as they come.
It was a great relief to the party when
they dived in among the pines and firs to
find that the gloomy dampness had lifted
and the sun was again shining from a clear
sky. It impressed all as a good omen.
</p>
<p>Noxon&#8217;s rest and care for his injured leg
had been of great benefit. The rising
inflammation had gone and the pain was
trifling. If they did not walk fast, he was
sure it would give him no anxiety.
</p>
<p>Calvert took the lead, with Noxon next
and Mike Murphy at the rear. The last
was highly pleased to see his young friend
walk without a perceptible limp.
</p>
<p>The leader kept his bearings so well that
when within an hour he reached the shore
of the Back River, it was at the spot he had
in mind. There was the runabout in which
he and Warner Hagan had come from Wiscasset,
and the owner was calmly smoking
his brier wood pipe, content to wait indefinitely
when he was well paid for so doing.
He lay a few rods south of the landing, and
just below him was the <i>Water Witch</i>, with
Alvin Landon and Chester Haynes on board,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
wondering what in the world had become of
Mike Murphy. The youths had tried to
open communication with the master of
the runabout, but he had been warned by
his two passengers to tell nothing to anyone,
and he glumly refused to talk. Chester
had set out in quest of the missing Mike,
going as far as the village. All he could
learn there was that his friend had left a
good while before and no one knew anything
of him. The second mate went back to his
Captain, and the two were so impatient that
they were half inclined to leave without
him, when lo! he appeared with Calvert and
Noxon, coming from among the trees as
if he had been absent only a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Then followed full explanations, and you
can imagine the astonishment of Alvin and
Chester. They were sure of the identity
of Noxon when he first appeared, but were
considerate and said never a word that could
hurt his feelings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ran away with their launch,&#8221;
added Calvert. &#8220;They ran away with
yours, and you and they met as you were
coming back. But for the fog you would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
have seen each other, for you must have
passed quite close. The beauty of it is,&#8221;
said the officer, with a flash of his keen eyes,
&#8220;that while they have gone far away we
know exactly where. My friend Hagan
and I, with Noxon as our guide, are going
to scoop them in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought it best not to affect too much
mystery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They passed down Montsweag Bay
clear to Knubble, through Goose Rock
Passage into the Sheepscot, and up that
to the Beautiful Isle of Somewhere. Most
folks don&#8217;t know the exact location of that
sweet spot, but we know&mdash;thanks to Noxon&mdash;the
latitude and longitude of ours, which
the same is the port we are heading for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The plan was simple. Noxon, who was
familiar with the running of the <i>Water
Witch</i>, was to act as engineer and steersman.
Calvert and Hagan would be the only
passengers, and the prize would be Kit
Woodford and Graff Miller.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And phwat&#8217;s to become of us?&#8221; asked
Mike.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends upon how you behave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
yourself. If you grow tired of waiting, take
a walk up to Beartown, have dinner with
Mrs. Friestone and then come back and
wait for a few days and nights till you see
us again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s aisy, as I told me taicher whin
she asked me how much two and two made
and I informed her the same was five.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Hagan isn&#8217;t here,&#8221; reminded
Chester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be very soon. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll
say a word to my man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked to the runabout, where he
told its owner he might return to Wiscasset
as he was not needed further. He added
a dollar to the price agreed upon and the
man bade him good-by. Hagan, who had
gone off on what might be called a reconnaissance,
justified the faith of his partner,
for he came forward, and thus the party
was complete.
</p>
<p>The distance was shorter by way of the
Narrows and down the Sheepscot than by
the route just named. Accordingly, the
<i>Water Witch</i> headed north, while the
<i>Deerfoot</i> it will be remembered went south.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
The difference was not much, the real
reason why the course was taken being
of another nature. If the <i>Water Witch</i> had
set out to search for the other boat, with
no knowledge of its destination, it would
have prowled to the southward, inspecting
all likely hiding places on the way, with a
strong chance that she herself would be
detected and her purpose read before she
discovered the fugitive. By taking the
northern route this handicap would be
avoided. They could make much better
progress and not be seen until it was too
late for the criminals to escape.
</p>
<p>Thus Alvin Landon, Chester Haynes and
Mike Murphy were left on the shore of the
Back River, near Beartown landing, without
any launch and compelled to pass the
time as best they could. They decided
to spend a few hours in the village.
</p>
<p>They appreciated the reason why Calvert
would not have their company. He was
plunging into a venture where deadly
weapons were likely to be used, and their
lives would be endangered. The affair was
really none of theirs. Besides, their presence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
would be a serious handicap and might
prove fatal to success.
</p>
<p>The <i>Water Witch</i> soon shot past Cushman
Point, passing the runabout so close that
the officers exchanged salutations with
the man who had brought them from
Wiscasset. Calvert and Hagan sat side by
side, both puffing heavy black cigars, the
smoke of which as it streamed astern might
have suggested that the launch was impelled
by steam instead of gasoline. She ran
smoothly, and Noxon, with a pale face, his
hands grasping the wheel, steered as skilfully
as Alvin Landon had directed the
swifter <i>Deerfoot</i>. He had done it many
times and had no fear. The young man
had come to the parting of the ways, and
nothing could turn him back. His resolution
was due to the wound, which had distressed
him so much when he hobbled to the home
of Mrs. McCaffry that he believed for a time
he was near the end of life, and when one
reaches <i>that</i> point he is sure to do some
serious thinking.
</p>
<p>Just above Clough Point, marking the
northern extremity of the large island of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Westport, the <i>Water Witch</i> turned eastward
through the Narrows and headed straight
south down the Sheepscot River to its destination
some ten miles away. Noxon seated
with his hands upon the wheel remained
silent. The officers spoke to each other now
and then in low tones, but most of the time
left him to his meditations. He held the
boat to moderate speed, for there was no
call for haste. She was running easily,
but a glance by the young man into the
gasoline tank showed the supply was low,
and he wished to avoid stopping at any of
the landings to renew it. Besides, high
speed is always a strain upon an engine, and
he was nervously anxious to prevent a
breakdown at a critical point in the enterprise.
His familiarity with the launch made
him cautious.
</p>
<p>While Calvert and Hagan were following
a clearly defined plan, they knew &#8220;there&#8217;s
many a slip &#8217;twixt the cup and the lip.&#8221;
They had high hopes of finding the other
boat at the spot which Calvert had facetiously
named the Beautiful Isle of Somewhere,
but it might well happen that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
would be disappointed. At the first sign of
danger the <i>Deerfoot</i> would run away and
her superior fleetness would leave her pursuers
hopelessly behind. Above all, it was
important that the criminals should not
discover their peril in time to get away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noxon,&#8221; said Calvert, leaning forward,
&#8220;let us know when we are near the cove.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are within less than a mile of it
now. It is just ahead on the right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Each officer flung his stump of a cigar
overboard and slipped from his chair to
the bottom of the boat. Inasmuch as their
interest was centred on one side of the boat,
they crowded each other a little. They
removed their headgear and permitted only
their crowns to show a few inches above the
rail as they peered over. They held themselves
ready at the same time to duck into
complete invisibility.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cove is in sight,&#8221; announced Noxon,
slightly turning his head. &#8220;Better keep
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A few minutes later they felt the change in
the course of the launch. They were
entering the inlet and the officers raised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
their heads barely enough to peer alongside
of the steersman, over the front and beyond
the flagstaff with its fluttering bunting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; whispered Calvert to his
friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;the Beautiful
Isle of Somewhere; we are closer to it than
I supposed.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Through Ticket to Home</span></h3>
</div>

<p>There it was in plain sight, rising
like a giant nosegay of emerald from
the crystalline water. It was barely
two acres in extent, and, like nearly all islands
great and small in southern Maine, the
firs, pines and spruce grew to the very edge
of the water. It reminded one of the patches
of green earth in Europe where the frugal
owners do not allow a square inch to go to
waste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything of the <i>Deerfoot</i>,&#8221;
said Calvert in a guarded voice to Noxon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We always lay to on the other side.
Keep down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was wise advice, though not needed.
The two crouched so low in their crowded
quarters that a person a hundred feet away
would not have seen them. Each instinctively
felt of his hip pocket. The little
weapon was there.
</p>
<p>The officers had now to depend upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
Noxon, who for the time was director of the
enterprise. He could make himself heard
over his shoulder without drawing attention
to himself, provided he was under the eye
of his old associates. He was never more
alert.
</p>
<p>Veering to the right, where there was a
hundred yards of clear water between the
islet and the mainland, he slowed down and
began gradually circling the exuberant
patch of earth. It will be remembered
that he had been there before and knew
the habits of Woodford and Miller. By
and by, he had glided far enough to bring
the western shore into his field of vision.
Before that moment he had discerned the
stern and flagstaff of a launch. A second
glance told him the truth, which he cautiously
made known to the crouching forms
behind him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Deerfoot</i> is there! Don&#8217;t stir till I
give the word!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Neither of the criminals was in sight,
but it was evident they were near, else the
launch would not be lying where it was.
Noxon gave a series of toots with his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
whistle, though the noise of the exhaust
must have been noted before. In response,
Kit Woodford and Graff Miller came out
from among the trees, halted at the side of
the launch and stared at the <i>Water Witch</i>
and its single occupant.
</p>
<p>Could they believe their eyes? They saw
before them their own boat and the young
man whom they had cowardly deserted in
his extremity. What was the explanation
to be?
</p>
<p>By this time the parties were so near that
they could talk with only a slight raise in
their voices. Kit Woodford was the first to
open his mouth. With a profane expletive
expressing his surprise, he demanded:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was on the tongue of Noxon to make a
biting reply, but he did not forget the part
he had to play.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found this boat at the wharf at Beartown
and thought I&#8217;d hunt you up. How
came you to have <i>that</i> launch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one had run off with ours and left
that. So we made a trade and I rather
think we got the best of the bargain. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
don&#8217;t understand how ours was found by
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the owners of that wanted to
trade back. I say, Kit, I would like to
know something&mdash;why did you and Graff
run off and leave me behind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t!&#8221; replied Woodford, with
virtuous indignation. &#8220;Me and Graff
hunted high and low for you and made up
our minds you had run off yourself with the
swag.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine lot of swag I had, when I had to
scoot just after I got the safe open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While this snatch of conversation was
going on, Noxon, who had cut off the power,
was edging nearer. Calvert and Hagan
squeezed each other so hard that it looked
as if they would push themselves through
the hull of the launch.
</p>
<p>Graff Miller now put in his oar:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we didn&#8217;t get a haul out of the measly
post office we&#8217;ve scooped a mighty fine
motor boat. We can sell it and gather in
enough to last us till we crack another
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t be as easy as it looks to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
you. The whole neighborhood is up in
arms and we shall have to lie low for awhile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got enough to keep us a
week or so&mdash;&mdash;<i>Nox, there&#8217;s somebody in the
boat with you</i>!&#8221; exclaimed Miller, who that
instant caught sight of the head of one of
the crouching men. The craft was now so
close that concealment was impossible.
In fact, in the same moment that the <i>Water
Witch</i> gently bumped against the other
boat, Stockham Calvert and Warner Hagan
straightened up and bounded across upon
the <i>Deerfoot</i>. Each grasped a revolver, and
Calvert shouted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up, or I&#8217;ll let daylight through
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The terrified Woodford turned to run,
but a bullet whistled past his ear. Perhaps
too he realized in that frightful instant that
no place of refuge awaited him. The island
was too small to allow him to hide himself.
He abruptly halted on the edge of the wood,
and facing about sullenly raised his hands.
</p>
<p>As for Graff Miller he did not attempt to
get away. Accepting the order addressed
to his leader as applying to himself, he stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
stock still and seemed to be doing the best
he could to keep the sky from falling on him.
</p>
<p>Knowing that Hagan would look after
him, Calvert gave his whole attention to
Woodford. Keeping his revolver presented,
he crossed the narrow deck of the <i>Deerfoot</i>
and dropped lightly to the ground. A
few steps took him to the cowardly ruffian.
Never lowering his weapon, he ran the other
hand over the outside of the man&#8217;s clothing
and twitched a revolver from his hip
pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do, Christopher; if you now
feel an inclination to lower your dirty hands,
you have my permission to do so. Perhaps
it will not tire you quite so much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hardly had he complied when a sharp
click sounded. So quickly that it looked
like a piece of magic a pair of handcuffs were
snapped upon the miscreant, and Hagan
was only a few seconds later in doing the
same with his prisoner.
</p>
<p>The capture of the two was so easy that
it suggested a farce.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had only put up a fight, Kit, it
would have been a good deal more interesting,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
said Calvert, &#8220;but you always were
one of the biggest cowards that ever made a
bluff at being a bad man. Get a move on
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As meekly as a lamb the prisoner stepped
upon the nearest launch, and, as ordered,
seated himself on one of the seats at the
stern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to go there too?&#8221;
humbly asked Graff Miller.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; step lively.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Calvert explained what was to be done.
The handcuffed prisoners were to be taken
to Wiscasset on the <i>Deerfoot</i>, their captors
bearing them company. In that city they
would be locked up, and every step that followed
would be strictly in accordance with
law.
</p>
<p>Noxon was to trail after the launch in
the <i>Water Witch</i>. There was more than one
reason for this arrangement. Since both
boats were capable of making good speed,
it was better than to have one tow the other.
If the <i>Water Witch&#8217;s</i> gasoline gave out, the
<i>Deerfoot</i> could take it in tow, but this would
not be done unless the necessity arose.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>The separation of Noxon from his former
associates would prevent an unpleasant
scene. Kit Woodford and Graff Miller
could not fail to see that Noxon had given
them into the hands of the officers. While
they were powerless to harm the young
man, they could make it uncomfortable
for him despite the restraining presence
of Calvert and Hogan.
</p>
<p>It is safe to say that none of the steamers
and other boats encountered on that memorable
voyage up stream suspected the meaning
of what they saw. One launch was gliding
evenly up the river with a second closely
resembling it a hundred yards or more to
the rear. In the latter sat a young man.
In the former were four persons, two of
whom had been engaged for weeks in robbing
post offices in the State of Maine. No one
observed that they wore handcuffs, or
dreamed that the man handling the wheel
was a famous detective. In this case he
was Calvert, who had a fair knowledge of
running a motor boat.
</p>
<p>The prisoners were sullen and silent for
most of the way. Hagan, seated behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
Calvert, could protect him from any treacherous
attack with the handcuffs. The
detective was too wise to invite an assault
of that nature.
</p>
<p>When a turn in the course brought the
long Wiscasset bridge in sight with the
pretty town on the left, Kit Woodford
turned his head and looked back at the
young man who was guiding the other
launch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with <i>him</i>?&#8221;
he asked, with a black scowl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Hagan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you got the bracelets on
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has done us too valuable service.
That isn&#8217;t the way we reward our friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Calvert, who had overheard the words,
looked round.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may need his evidence to land you
and Graff in Atlanta.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The remark was so illuminating that the
prisoner said never a word. The occasion
was one of those in which language falls
short of doing justice to the emotions of the
persons chiefly involved. It was Graff
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
Miller who snarled with a smothered rage
which it is hard to picture:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get even with him if I have to wait
ten years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to wait all of that and
probably longer,&#8221; said Calvert, &#8220;and by
that time I don&#8217;t think Orestes Noxon will
care much what you try to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective pronounced the name with
emphasis, to learn whether it attracted any
notice. It did not so far as he could judge,
whereat he was glad.
</p>
<p>The criminals were put behind bars, and
the young man strolled through the street
to the railway station. On the way, the
elder said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks to me as if you have a clear
title to the <i>Water Witch</i>. What do you wish
to do with it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell it to someone so I shall never see
it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will turn the boat over to me I
think I can dispose of it for you. Have you
any price in mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell the launch for whatever you can get,
if it isn&#8217;t more than twenty-three cents.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll fix it. Here is the railway
office. You have enough funds?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty. I shall a buy a through ticket
to&mdash;<i>home</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. I shall call upon you this
autumn. Good-by, Horace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by to one of the best friends I
ever had. God bless you!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Gathering Up the Ravelled Threads</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The records show that not long ago
there were a number of post office
robberies among the towns and villages
in that section of Maine to which some
attention has been given in the preceding
pages. Not all the guilty parties were captured,
but we know of two, or rather three,
who were caught in the toils. Two of them,
Kit Woodford and Graff Miller, were convicted
in the United States Court at Portland,
for, to use a common expression, they
were caught with the goods on them, and
sentenced to long terms in the Atlanta
penitentiary. There they are sure to stay
for an indefinite time to come, provided they
are not soon released on parole, or pardoned
on the ground of poor health. Let us hope
for better things.
</p>
<p>During the trial of the criminals inquiries
were heard for the third member of the gang,
but he seemed to have vanished as completely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
as if the earth had opened and
swallowed him. Possibly the Judge learned
all the facts from Detective Calvert and
saw that justice would be best served by
winking at the youth&#8217;s offence. Moreover,
an officer of the law cannot be punished for
the escape of a prisoner unless gross carelessness
or collusion is proved, which was not
easy in the case named. Be that as it may,
Orestes Noxon no longer exists. In his
place rises another young man, &#8220;redeemed
and disenthralled&#8221;&mdash;a brand plucked from
the burning. The grandest work of our
penal institution is that of reforming instead
of wreaking revenge upon the erring ones.
It certainly proved so in the instance named.
The parents of the youth knew he had
strayed from the narrow path, but it will be
a long time before they learn how far his
wayward footsteps led him. There is no
need of their ever knowing the painful truth.
Detective Calvert simply told the grateful
father that his boy had gotten into bad
company, but the error could never be repeated,
nor can I believe it ever will be.
</p>
<p>One day Gideon Landon, the wealthy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
banker and capitalist of New York, received
a characteristic letter from his son Alvin.
He said his motor boat <i>Deerfoot</i> had been
housed for the winter, there to remain until
next summer, and he and Chester Haynes
had had the time of their lives, for which
they could never thank the kind parent
enough. The son meant to prove his
gratitude by acts instead of words, for he
intended to buckle down to hard work and
not rest until he was through West Point
and had become General of the United
States Army. He added:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;And now, my dear father, I want you to do
a favor or two for me, Chester and Mike Murphy,
who is one of the best fellows that ever lived. Some
time I shall tell you all our experience after you left
the bungalow on Southport Island. I know you
will agree with what I say.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please send to &#8216;Uncle Ben Trotwood,&#8217; Trevett,
on Hodgdon Island, Boothbay Township, Maine,
a big lot of fine smoking tobacco. While you are
about it you may as well make it half a ton, more
or less. In his old age, he doesn&#8217;t do much else but
smoke, eat, sleep, and talk bass, but he was very
kind to Chester and me. He kept us overnight and
fed us, and was insulted when we wished to pay
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
him.&#8221;  (No reference was made to Uncle Ben&#8217;s
frugal wife.)
</p>
</div>
<p>The genial old man would never have
solved the mystery of the arrival of the big
consignment of the weed had it not been
accompanied by a letter from the two boys
in which all was made clear.
</p>
<p>(Another paragraph from Alvin&#8217;s communication
to his father.)
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;In the little town or village of Beartown live
the sweetest mother and daughter in the State of
Maine. Anyhow, there is none kinder and more
loving. The name of the daughter, who isn&#8217;t out
of short dresses yet, is Nora Friestone. Send her a
fine first class piano&mdash;no second-hand one&mdash;with
about a bushel of music. Select any stuff you choose,
not forgetting a copy of &#8216;The Sweet Long Ago,&#8217;
published by C. W. Thompson, Boston. I wish
you could have heard Mike Murphy sing that for
them. He has one of the finest voices in the world.
If he would only study and cultivate it, he would
be a second Caruso. I will send an explanatory
letter to Mrs. Friestone, so you needn&#8217;t bother to
write her.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>And the Steinway duly reached its destination.
Mother and daughter were overwhelmed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
They would have insisted that
a tremendous mistake had been made had
not a letter reached them at the same time
from the bungalow. This was signed by
Chester Haynes, Mike Murphy and Alvin
Landon. It begged Miss Nora to accept
the present as a token of their appreciation
of the hospitality received by them, and
in memory of an interesting night they had
spent in the Friestone home not long before.
Nora wrote one of the most delightful
replies that goodness and innocence could
pen, and assured the donors that the
prayers of her mother and herself would
follow the three as long as mother and
daughter lived.
</p>
<p>(Another paragraph from Alvin&#8217;s communication
to his father.)
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;You must understand that the expense of these
presents, including that which follows, is borne by
you and Mr. Haynes. He knew all about them and
is as ardent as we. He says he is sure you will be
as glad as he to help in so good a cause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One more trifling gift and I shall be through.
About a half mile from Beartown lives a poor Irish
day laborer known to every one as Tam McCaffry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
Chester and I did not have the pleasure of meeting
him, but Mike spent some time at his home, where
his big, jolly wife proved herself the soul of hospitality.
She is Irish through and through. Mr.
Calvert saw her and says the great attraction of the
woman, aside from her natural goodness, is that
she is the only person he has yet met who in the way
of repartee and wit could give Mike as good as he
sent. It was a treat to hear the two spar, and Mike
admitted that he had met his match.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Send her a pianola. Her hands are too big and
untrained to master the keys of a piano, but there
is nothing the matter with her feet, which is all she
needs to work one of those contrivances. Don&#8217;t
forget to include a whole lot of music, which should
be of the Irish vintage, such as Moore&#8217;s melodies,
&#8216;Sweet Mavoureen,&#8217; &#8216;The Rocky Road to Dublin,&#8217;
&#8216;St. Patrick&#8217;s Day in the Morning,&#8217; &#8216;Rory O&#8217;Moore,&#8217;
and so on. Be sure that the expense is prepaid all
the way to the McCaffry door. Mike is specially
interested in this present and contributes more than
both of us, for he gives his all, the same being twenty-five
cents, and to him we have assigned the duty of
explaining things to the good woman.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>Alvin had his father well trained, and he
cheerfully granted every request of his son.
He smiled and remarked to his wife after
reading the letter to her:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Alvin has never caused us an hour of
anxiety. He would not ask these things
without good reason. I shall give orders
when I go to the office that everything he
wishes shall be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was rather nice on the part of
Mr. Haynes to say what he did of you, Gideon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Franklin hasn&#8217;t anything mean in
his nature.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it a pity that while
his boy and ours are so fond of each other
their fathers are not on speaking terms?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps so, but there must always be
two persons to a quarrel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are one of them in this case.
I mean to call on Sophia this very day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haynes flew up before he had time to
understand all the facts in that little affair
of ours. If he had waited he would have
found that he had no cause for grievance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you call on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The banker shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is asking too much; it would be
humiliating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now when a sensible wife makes up her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
mind that her husband shall do a certain
thing, and when that husband wishes to
do it, but allows a false pride to hold him
back, you may make up your mind that the
aforesaid thing will be done with no unnecessary
delay.
</p>
<p>So it was that Gideon Landon went to
Franklin Haynes and they had not talked
ten minutes when the cloud between
them vanished. Friendship and full trust
were restored and can never be broken
again. It was another illustration of the
good that often flows from small deeds and
even smaller words.

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Aunt Maggie</span>:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking that about the time this luv letter
raiches ye, an insthrumint will do the same, which
the name is peeanoler, or something like that. I
beg ye to accipt the thrifle as a prisent from Captain
Landon, Second Mate Haynes and First Mate
mesilf. I know Misther Noxon would crack his
heels togither fur the chance of j&#8217;ining wid us, but
he forgot to lave his card and I suspict he&#8217;s sailed
for Europe not to be back fur fifteen or twinty
years, as was the case wid me great uncle whin he
sailed for Botny Bay.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The peagnoluh&mdash;I&#8217;m thrying all ways of spelling
the name of the blamed thing so as to get the same
right wunst any way&mdash;is played wid the feet. You
slide the sheet wid the holes punched into &#8217;em into
the wrack over the keeze and then wurrk the feet
up and down like yer husband Tana used to do at
home in the treadmill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to sing along wid the music for somebody
might hear ye. Me worry is that yer teeny
Sinderilla feet won&#8217;t be able to wurruk the peddles,
and if ye put on the shoes ye wore whin hanging
out the clothes, there wont be room in the house for
the peanholler, so ye might try the same widout
yer shoes and stockings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wid regards to Tam and much love to yersilf
I am ever

</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;My darlint broth of a boy:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It tuk me and Tam 2 nights and 3 days to understand
the maaning of the action of Jim Doogan the
carter in drawing up his taam to our risidence and
tumbling out a big shiny box wid the remark that
there wasn&#8217;t a cint to pay. Tam hadn&#8217;t got home
and Jim carried the purty thing into the parler and
leaned it aginst the flure. He had obsarved something
of the kind in his travels and he showed me
how to wurruk it wid me faat. Whin he slipped in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
one of the shaats of paper, wid hundreds of little
kriss-kross holes through it, sot down on the stule
and wobbled his butes, and &#8216;Killarney&#8217; filled the
room, I let out a hoop, kicked off me satan slippers,
danced a jig and shouted, &#8216;For the love of Mike!&#8217;
which the same is thrue, that being yer name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My number 10 shoes fit the peddlers as yer snub
nose fits yer freckled face. Tam and me spind the
time whin we aint slaaping or eating or working in
playing the thing and thinking of yersilf and the
byes you spake of.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me darling Mike, may the birds wake ye aich
morning wid their swaat songs of praise and soothe
ye to slaap in the avening; may the sun shine fur
ye ivery day through; may yer draams be of angels
and no man or woman spake anything but wurruds
of love to ye; and whin old age bows yer head and
the time comes to lave us all, may ye be welcomed to
heaven wid the blessed graating: &#8216;Well done, good
and faithful servant!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you and the other byes come soon and see
what a happy home ye have made for Tam and me.
